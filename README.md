## 🌟 About the Project

Hi, I'm **Daniele**, and I’m a hardcore gaming fanatic! 🕹️

I developed this project to faithfully simulate the **SteamOS ecosystem** on standard desktops and laptops. My goal is to bring that "console-like" feeling to your Linux machine, specifically optimized for **AMD Radeon** and **Intel Graphics**.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🔄 Seamless Session Switching**:
  Native support for the **"Switch to Desktop"** button. Transition between Gamescope and KDE Plasma without ever seeing a login screen or typing a password, thanks to our privileged SDDM helper.

* **🎮 Pure Console Experience**:
  * **Intelligent Launcher**: Automatically detects your hardware and display resolution on the first boot.
    
  * **Safety Watchdog**: If a session fails to initialize (e.g., due to bad settings), it automatically triggers a **Safe Mode** relaunch, bypassing custom configs to ensure you always reach the UI.
    
  * **Talking Config**: A detailed template is installed at `~/.config/steamos-diy/config.example`. 
  The launcher will automatically generate your operational `config` file on the first run. 
  Use the `.example` file as a guide to safely customize your experience!

* **📏 Hardware-Aware**: 
  Built-in toggles for HDR, VRR, and Mangoapp Performance Overlay via simple config edits.

* **🔴 Performance Ready**:
  Integrated with **Feral GameMode** and **MangoHud**. The installer automatically applies `setcap` to Gamescope for high-priority scheduling and zero stuttering.

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

* **GPU**: AMD Radeon or Intel Graphics (Mesa drivers).
* **Display Manager**: **SDDM** (Required for session switching logic).
* **Desktop Environment**: KDE Plasma 6.x (Recommended).
* **OS**: Arch Linux (or any Arch-based distro).
* **Core Software**: `steam`, `gamescope`, `mangohud`, `gamemode`.

## 🚀 Quick Installation

Follow these steps to transform your system. The installer will guide you through the process, detect your hardware, and handle all dependencies.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dlucca1986/SteamMachine-DIY.git
   ```

2. **Enter the folder**:
   ```
   cd SteamMachine-DIY
   ```
  
3. **Set Permission**:
   ```
   chmod +x install.sh
   ```
4. **Run the Installer**:
    ```
   sudo ./install.sh
   ```    

* 💡 **Note**: The installer is interactive and will automatically verify your AMD/Intel hardware, install missing dependencies, and configure the necessary system permissions.

## 🛡️ Clean Architecture & Safety

I value your system's integrity. This project follows a "system-safe" philosophy to ensure your Arch Linux installation remains clean and stable:

* **Non-Intrusive**: Real binaries and scripts are isolated in `/usr/local/bin/`. We use a dedicated directory `/usr/bin/steamos-polkit-helpers/` for symbolic links. This satisfies Steam's hardcoded path requirements without cluttering or overwriting files in your primary `/usr/bin/` directory.

* **Transparent Sudoers**: Security is paramount. A minimal, dedicated policy file is added to `/etc/sudoers.d/steamos-switcher`. It grants passwordless execution *only* to the specific scripts required for session switching, following the principle of least privilege.
  
* **Wayland-First Approach**: The project configures SDDM to run on Wayland. This is a strategic choice to ensure **Gamescope** can reliably claim the primary display socket, preventing common X11 resource conflicts and ensuring a seamless transition between the Desktop and Gaming Mode.

* **Full Reversibility**: Every system change, link, and configuration entry is tracked. The included uninstaller can revert your system to its original state at any time.

## 🗑️ Uninstallation
If you wish to revert all changes, I’ve included a dedicated uninstaller. 

It will completely remove all scripts, symbolic links, desktop shortcuts, and the sudoers rule:

```bash
chmod +x uninstall.sh
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```
