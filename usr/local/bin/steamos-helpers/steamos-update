# Description: Compatibility shim for SteamOS OTA update infrastructure.
#              On DIY Arch Linux systems, updates are managed via pacman.
#              This script ensures the Steam UI "Check for Updates" flow
#              completes without errors.
# Path:        /usr/local/bin/steamos-helpers/steamos-update
# =============================================================================

# --- Environment & Configuration ---
# In a DIY environment, we avoid triggering a full system upgrade (pacman -Syu)
# automatically from the Steam UI to prevent potential partial upgrades
# or unexpected reboots. The user is expected to manage updates via terminal.

# --- Main Logic ---

# We return exit 0 to notify the Steam Client that the update check 
# was successfully processed. This prevents the "Update Error" message
# from appearing in the Gaming Mode overlay.

exit 0
