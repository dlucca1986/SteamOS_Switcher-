# Script: steamos-set-timezone
# Description: Compatibility shim for SteamOS timezone synchronization.
#              Redirects Steam Client timezone requests to system settings.
# Path:        /usr/local/bin/steamos-helpers/steamos-set-timezone
# =============================================================================

# --- Environment & Configuration ---
# We keep this script minimal to ensure maximum compatibility with the 
# Steam Client UI expectations while running on a DIY Arch Linux base.

# --- Main Logic ---

# Steam passes the timezone string as the first argument (e.g., "Europe/Rome").
# On DIY systems, we let the host OS handle time synchronization via NTP/timedatectl.
TARGET_ZONE="${1:-UTC}"

# We return exit 0 to signal to the Steam Client that the request was 
# intercepted and handled, preventing "Settings fail" overlays.

exit 0
