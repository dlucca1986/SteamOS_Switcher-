## [2.1.8] — 2026-08-26 — Continuous Integration & Centralization Pass

### Added
- **Continuous Integration**: `.github/workflows/quality-gates.yml` runs on every push/PR to
  `testing` and `stable`, one job step per gate (pylint on production code, flake8, ruff,
  bandit, radon cc, radon mi, vulture, pytest, pylint on the test suite, shellcheck) —
  mirrors CLAUDE.md's local review checklist verbatim, so a red X in the Actions UI points
  straight at which tool failed. `radon cc`/`radon mi` don't have a built-in fail-on-threshold
  flag (they always exit 0 regardless of findings), so each gets a short inline check instead:
  fail the step if any function is grade C or worse, or any file drops below maintainability
  grade A.
- `vulture_whitelist.py` (repo root, generated via `vulture --make-whitelist`): covers exactly
  the Qt/tarfile/ruamel false positives CLAUDE.md already documented. vulture's own exit code
  is nonzero on any finding, including known false positives, so a whitelist was required for
  it to function as a real CI pass/fail gate instead of a manually-eyeballed report. Lives
  outside `usr/local/lib/steamos_diy/`, so `install.sh`'s deploy step never ships it.
- `shellcheck` added to the local/CI gate list now that it's available in the dev environment.
  `install.sh`'s only finding, `SC2086` on `pacman -Syu $BASE_PKGS $DRIVER_PKGS`, is intentional
  word-splitting on two fixed-literal, space-separated package lists (never user input) — each
  package must reach `pacman` as its own argv entry, so quoting would break installation.
  Documented with a `# shellcheck disable=SC2086` and a one-line reason. `uninstall.sh` is clean.

### Security
- **Self-update integrity verification**: `download_release()` in `utils.py` previously
  fetched and extracted a GitHub release tarball with no integrity check before
  `install.sh` inside it ran with elevated privileges — flagged in CLAUDE.md as the
  project's highest-value supply-chain risk. It now requires a `SHA256SUMS` release
  asset (added to `ReleaseInfo` via `_release_from_api()`'s new `_find_checksum_url()`),
  fetches and validates the digest format via the new `_fetch_expected_sha256()`, and
  streams the tarball into a temp file while hashing it (`_download_verified_tarball()`)
  before ever calling `tarfile.extractall`. Missing, malformed, or mismatched checksums
  abort the download entirely (fail-closed) rather than degrading to an unverified
  extraction. This makes attaching a `SHA256SUMS` asset a required manual step of the
  release process from this version on (documented in CLAUDE.md's new "Release process"
  section) — a release published without one cannot be installed via the in-app updater.
  This defends against transport-level corruption/tampering of the download only, not
  against a compromised publishing account (no independent signature).
- **Update-installer TOCTOU**: `download_release()` now returns an `ExtractedRelease`
  (extracted dir + `install.sh`'s own SHA-256, via the new `_sha256_file()`) instead of a
  bare `Path`. `updater.py::_on_download` re-verifies that hash (`verify_file_sha256()`)
  immediately before handing `install.sh` to `pkexec`, right after the blocking "Installing
  Update" dialog closes. Previously, the only integrity check happened at download time,
  before an unbounded, modal wait for the user's OK click — during that window, anything
  already running as the same desktop user could overwrite `install.sh` in its
  user-writable destination directory and have it executed as root on the next click, a
  distinct local-privilege-escalation path from the compromised-GitHub-account threat model
  the SHA-256 download check above already covers. Verified end-to-end (untampered file
  still installs normally; a file swapped after download is blocked before `pkexec` runs).
- **`download_release()` prune ordering, follow-up fix**: the fix above only protected
  against a checksum-mismatched download costing the last known-good cached release —
  a checksum-*valid* tarball that then failed extraction (`tarfile.TarError`, a full disk)
  or turned out not to contain `install.sh` still pruned the old cache before either of
  those checks ran. `_prune_downloads()` now runs only after extraction succeeds and
  `install.sh` is confirmed present, and takes a `keep=target` argument so the
  just-extracted new version is never pruned as if it were a stale one (found during
  this session's second code-review pass, 2026-08-27).
- **`_run_pkexec`'s sticky-on-timeout lock, narrowed to where it's actually needed**:
  the 300s pkexec timeout added for checklist item 14 above counts however long the user
  takes at the polkit password prompt against the same budget as the operation itself —
  for journal vacuum (idempotent, sub-second real work, no file-overlap risk from a second
  concurrent run) a timeout there is far more likely to be a slow/abandoned auth prompt
  than a genuinely wedged operation, so leaving its lock permanently stuck until a Control
  Center restart was pure downside. `_run_pkexec` gained a `sticky_on_timeout` keyword
  (default `True`, preserving Backup/Restore's existing "may still be writing files, don't
  risk a second overlapping run" behavior); `cleanup_logs_privileged` now passes
  `sticky_on_timeout=False`, so a vacuum timeout resets its lock like any other error
  instead of requiring a restart (found during this session's second code-review pass,
  2026-08-27).
- **Corrected a misleading `_run_pkexec` comment (and CLAUDE.md checklist item 20 itself)**:
  both claimed every argv passed to `pkexec` was "a fixed literal, never built from GUI
  input" — false for `run_restore()`, which appends the user-selected archive path from
  `QFileDialog` as its own argv element. Not currently exploitable (no shell is invoked,
  and `restore.py` independently validates the archive), but a future reviewer trusting
  the comment could skip scrutinizing the one argv slot that actually varies with user
  input. Both now state the real invariant: no argv element may be built by
  string-concatenating GUI input into a larger token; a raw, whole GUI-provided value
  passed as its own list element is fine (found during this session's second code-review
  pass, 2026-08-27).
- **Restored adjacency for `_https_open`'s `# nosec B310` justification**: the reason
  (every caller already confirms `https://` before calling in) had only been in the
  function's docstring since the `_https_open()` extraction, several lines above an
  intervening `# pylint: disable` and `import` statement — CLAUDE.md requires the same
  one-line-reason-on-the-line convention every other suppression in this codebase
  follows. `scripts/audit-suppressions.py` now reports zero unjustified markers (found
  during this session's second code-review pass, 2026-08-27).
- **`_refresh_service_status` re-entrancy guard**: `get_service_status()`'s subprocess
  timeout (`timeout=5`) is longer than the `QTimer` interval that polls it every 4s, so
  a slow `systemctl show` could let the next tick launch a second thread/subprocess
  before the first returned, piling up under load instead of simply skipping a cycle —
  exactly the "wedged handheld" scenario this session's hardening pass otherwise targets.
  `control_center.py` gained a `_service_status_busy` flag, following the same shape as
  `_pkexec_busy`: a tick is skipped while a poll is already in flight, and the flag resets
  once `get_service_status()` returns (found during this session's second code-review
  pass, 2026-08-27).
- **`refresh_detected_games` staleness guard** (CLAUDE.md checklist item 17): the "Scan
  History" button had no guard against a second click starting an overlapping journalctl
  scan — if a slower first scan finished after a faster second one, its stale result would
  silently overwrite the fresher one in the games combo box. Added a `_scan_games_busy`
  flag, same shape as `_pkexec_busy`/`_service_status_busy`: a second scan attempt while
  one is in flight is now a no-op instead of racing (found during this session's second
  code-review pass, 2026-08-27).
- **Visual busy-state on Backup/Restore/Vacuum buttons** (CLAUDE.md checklist item 15):
  these three buttons previously never reflected `_pkexec_busy` at all — the only feedback
  for a double-click was a 3s status-bar toast, and once a timeout permanently locked
  Backup/Restore the buttons kept looking fully clickable indefinitely, unlike
  `updater.py`'s named `_set_busy` reference pattern. `control_center.py` now tracks each
  button in `_lock_key_buttons` (keyed by `lock_key`) and disables it the moment
  `_run_pkexec` starts; a new `pkexec_lock_released` signal — emitted only when the lock
  actually clears — lets a main-thread slot (`_on_pkexec_lock_released`) re-enable it,
  since Qt widgets must never be touched directly from the background worker thread
  (found during this session's second code-review pass, 2026-08-27).
- **Subprocess timeout discipline** (CLAUDE.md review checklist item 14): every
  `subprocess.run()` call that talks to a system daemon (`systemctl`, `journalctl`, `pkexec`)
  now carries an explicit `timeout=` and a handler for `TimeoutExpired` — `health.py`'s
  `get_service_status` (`timeout=5`), `journal.py`'s `fetch_tagged_entries` and
  `_run_journalctl_iso` (`timeout=10` each), `restore.py`'s `_reload_systemd` (`timeout=10`),
  `utils.py`'s `fix_ownership` (`timeout=30`), and `control_center.py`'s `_run_pkexec` worker
  and journalctl-scan calls (`timeout=300`/`timeout=10`). Previously an unresponsive daemon —
  plausible on a handheld that can wedge or lose power mid-operation — could hang a worker
  thread indefinitely with no way to recover short of killing the process. Every widened
  `except` clause now catches `subprocess.SubprocessError` (the common superclass of both
  `CalledProcessError` and `TimeoutExpired`) instead of just `CalledProcessError`, so the new
  timeout path degrades the same way an existing failure already did, without adding a second
  exception type to every call site.
- **Symlink-follow on backup/restore's tmp write path**: `restore.py`'s `_ensure_safe_target()`
  only checked the final extraction target for a pre-existing symlink, never the sibling
  `<target>.sdy_restore_tmp` path `_write_member` actually opened with a plain `open(...,
  "wb")`. `backup.py` had the same gap: `tarfile.open(tmp_path, "w:gz")` uses the builtin
  `open()` internally, which follows symlinks, and `tmp_path` lives in the user-writable
  `~/.config/steamos_diy/backups/` with a second-granularity timestamp. Both run as root via
  `pkexec`, so another process running as the same local user could plant a symlink at either
  predictable path ahead of time and have root write archive content through it to an
  arbitrary file — deterministic, no race required. Both now open their tmp path with
  `O_NOFOLLOW` (`backup.py` also adds `O_EXCL`, since its tmp path is freshly derived per run)
  instead of a plain `open()`/`tarfile.open()`, refusing to follow a pre-existing symlink
  there; `_write_member` now returns `bool` so `_extract_member` aborts cleanly instead of
  `chmod`-ing a target that was never written. Found via a full-file 8-agent review of
  `control_center.py`/`backup.py`/`restore.py`/`health.py` (2026-08-31, none had had this
  review pass before).

### Fixed
- 3 more doc-drift corrections found by the same review: `CHANGELOG.md`'s own
  `shlex_split_or_fallback()` entry still claimed `_schedule_post_start_cmds` kept its old
  skip-on-malformed-entry behavior "unchanged," contradicted by a later `Fixed` entry in the
  same release that unified it onto the shared degrade-and-run contract; `docs/Steamos
  Session Launch.md` claimed a malformed `post_start_cmds` entry "is skipped" instead of
  degrading and still running; `docs/Utilities Engine.md`'s `updater.py` import-list table
  omitted `verify_file_sha256`, added by the 2.1.8 TOCTOU fix.
- `updater.py`: three small gaps in the same download/install path — `check()`'s and
  `_download()`'s `.emit()` calls sat outside (or partially outside) their worker's
  try/except, so closing the Control Center window while a check/download is still in
  flight (Qt tears down the signal object) raised `RuntimeError` uncaught in the daemon
  thread; `_on_download()` discarded `spawn_native()`'s return value (`0` on failure), so a
  Konsole launch failure left the user seeing "Installing Update..." and then nothing;
  `verify_file_sha256()`'s TOCTOU re-check had no try/except of its own, so `install.sh`
  vanishing in that window raised `OSError` uncaught inside a Qt main-thread slot instead of
  failing closed. All three now degrade instead of crashing/hanging silently. Found via a
  full-file 9-agent review of `session_launch.py`/`session_select.py`/`sdy.py`/`editors.py`/
  `updater.py` (2026-08-31).
- `session_launch.py`: `_schedule_post_start_cmds`'s daemon thread had no try/except at
  all. A negative `POST_START_DELAY` (a plausible SSoT typo — `get_ssot_num` only validates
  it parses as a float, not that it's non-negative) reached `time.sleep()` raw, raising
  `ValueError` uncaught — silently dropping every `post_start_cmds` entry with no
  diagnostic. Clamped the delay to `0` (a negative value now degrades to "run immediately"
  instead of skipping the commands) and added a try/except backstop, same pattern already
  used for `updater.py::_download`'s worker. Found via a full-file 9-agent review of
  `session_launch.py`/`session_select.py`/`sdy.py`/`editors.py`/`updater.py` (2026-08-31,
  exception-contract-honesty angle).
- `sdy.py`: `_header_declares_id` caught only `OSError` around a text-mode `open(...,
  encoding="utf-8")`, the same gap already fixed in `utils.py::read_session_target` this
  cycle — a non-UTF-8 game profile (e.g. hand-edited with an accented name saved in
  Latin-1) raised `UnicodeDecodeError` uncaught into `sdy.py::run()`, which nothing wraps,
  crashing the game launch with a raw traceback instead of degrading, and before any `jlog`
  call so there's no diagnostic trail either. Now also catches `UnicodeDecodeError`. Found
  via a full-file 9-agent review of `session_launch.py`/`session_select.py`/`sdy.py`/
  `editors.py`/`updater.py` (2026-08-31, exception-contract-honesty angle).
- `control_center.py`: `_atomic_save` called `yaml_parser.load(content)` only to validate
  syntax, discarding the parsed result. A syntactically valid YAML document whose root isn't
  a mapping (e.g. a bare list, from a paste mistake while editing a game profile) reported
  "Configuration saved!" even though `utils.py::load_yaml_safe()` — the reader
  `sdy.py`/`session_launch.py` both use — silently degrades that exact shape to `{}` on the
  next load, dropping the whole profile with only a WARN-level `YAML_NOT_MAPPING` log line
  the user has no reason to see. Now rejects a parsed-but-non-dict root the same way a YAML
  syntax error already is — shown as a "Syntax Error" dialog instead of silently writing
  content that won't load back the way the user expects. Found via a full-file 9-agent
  review of `session_launch.py`/`session_select.py`/`sdy.py`/`editors.py`/`updater.py`
  (2026-08-31, cross-file-contracts angle).
- `session_launch.py`: `_build_gamescope_args`/`_get_post_start_cmds` both used
  `cfg.get(key) or []`, which only substitutes the default for a falsy value. A truthy
  non-list typo in a hand-edited `config.yaml` (e.g. `flags: true` or
  `post_start_cmds: 1`) made the subsequent iteration raise `TypeError` uncaught — in
  `run()`, before `_run_session`'s try/except even starts. With `Restart=on-failure` this
  crash-loops the systemd unit on every Game Mode boot attempt (the default/most common
  persisted `next_session` state), with no chance for the existing crash-recovery-to-Desktop
  mechanism to run, since the crash happens before it's ever reached. Guarded both with
  `isinstance(..., list)`, matching the pattern `utils.py::apply_env_map` already uses one
  line above for the same class of field. Found independently by two separate review agents
  (correctness and exception-contract-honesty angles) in a full-file 9-agent review of
  `session_launch.py`/`session_select.py`/`sdy.py`/`editors.py`/`updater.py` (2026-08-31).
- `docs/Utilities Engine.md` still described `download_release()` as returning a bare
  `Path`/`None`, from before the 2.1.8 TOCTOU fix changed it to return an
  `ExtractedRelease(dir, install_sh_sha256)`. Updated the function table row and added one
  for `verify_file_sha256()`, the re-check helper `updater.py` calls right before `pkexec`.
  Found via a full-file 9-agent review of `journal.py`/`utils.py` (2026-08-31, docs-drift
  angle).
- `control_center.py`: `refresh_detected_games`'s journalctl scan decoded output with
  `subprocess.run`'s default strict UTF-8, unlike `journal.py`'s own journalctl calls
  (`fetch_tagged_entries`/`_run_journalctl_iso`), which already use `errors="replace"`
  because a `MESSAGE` field with an embedded newline flips journalctl's export format to
  binary-safe encoding, not guaranteed valid UTF-8. An undecodable byte raised
  `UnicodeDecodeError`, uncaught by the existing `except (SubprocessError, OSError)` clause —
  silently killing the daemon thread (stderr is `/dev/null` when the app is launched
  detached) and leaving "Scanning history..." stuck forever. Added `errors="replace"`,
  matching `journal.py`'s pattern; the now textually-identical 5-line kwargs block triggered
  pylint's `duplicate-code` check, suppressed with a targeted disable and a one-line reason
  (a deliberate mirror of an established safety pattern, not independently reimplemented
  logic worth extracting). Found via a full-file 9-agent review of `journal.py`/`utils.py`
  (2026-08-31, exception-contract-honesty angle).
- `helpers/*.py`: each shim's `except ImportError` around `from utils import run_shim` was
  meant to guarantee Steam always gets a well-formed fallback exit code (0 or 7) even when
  the project library is unusable — but `utils.py`'s own module-level guard against a
  missing `libcore.so` raises `SystemExit(127)`, not `ImportError`. A missing/corrupted `.so`
  (e.g. mid-upgrade) made every shim propagate exit 127 instead of its documented fallback,
  confusing Steam's own update UI with an unexpected code instead of the intended
  "OK (Simulated)"/"up to date" signal. Widened each shim's except clause to
  `(ImportError, SystemExit)`; `utils.py` itself is untouched — real entry points
  (`session_launch.py`, `control_center.py`, etc.) have no fallback and correctly hard-fail
  at 127 if the C-Core can't load. Found via a full-file 9-agent review of
  `journal.py`/`utils.py` (2026-08-31, cross-file-contracts angle).
- `utils.py`/`updater.py`: `download_release()`'s post-extraction loop (`target.iterdir()`,
  `_sha256_file(installer)`) ran outside the function's own `try`/`except`, so a
  checksum-verified but structurally empty tarball — `tarfile.extractall()` never creates the
  destination directory when the archive has zero members — raised `FileNotFoundError`
  uncaught, contradicting the docstring's "`None` on any failure" contract. Moved the loop
  inside the existing `try`. Separately, `updater.py`'s `UpdateManager._download` worker had
  no `try`/`except` at all (unlike `check()`'s worker, safe because `check_latest_release()`
  never raises) — an uncaught exception there vanishes silently, same class of bug as the
  `validate_config` fix earlier this cycle, leaving the "⏳ Downloading…" button disabled
  forever with no error shown. Added a backstop that degrades to emitting `None`, reusing
  `_on_download`'s existing "failed" warning path. Found via a full-file 9-agent review of
  `journal.py`/`utils.py` (2026-08-31, exception-contract-honesty angle).
- `utils.py`: `read_session_target()`'s docstring promises "fall back to *default* on
  failure," but its `except OSError` clause doesn't cover `UnicodeDecodeError` (a `ValueError`
  subclass), raised by the text-mode `open(..., encoding="utf-8")` itself on non-UTF-8 bytes —
  same failure mode as the `health.py` YAML-read gap fixed earlier this cycle, but here the
  caller, `session_launch.py::run()` (the systemd service's entry point), wraps nothing around
  the call at all. A `next_session` file containing invalid UTF-8 — plausible after restoring
  a corrupted or hand-edited backup archive — would crash the session-launcher boot path
  instead of degrading to the `"steam"` default. Now also catches `UnicodeDecodeError`. Found
  via a full-file 9-agent review of `journal.py`/`utils.py` (2026-08-31,
  exception-contract-honesty angle).
- `restore.py`: `_allowed_prefixes()` was built from `home_real` alone, never consulting
  `get_backup_mapping()`'s own destination paths — so a `games_conf_dir` (or `next_session`)
  relocated via the SSoT to somewhere outside `/etc|/usr|/var|home` (e.g. external/SD-card
  storage, a supported pattern per the `user/games_conf_dir` mapping entry added earlier this
  cycle) was archived fine by `backup.py` but silently rejected by restore's
  `_is_path_safe()` check — logged only as a WARN-level `RESTORE_REJECTED_PATH`, with the
  overall restore still reporting `RESTORE_SUCCESS` since other members matched, so every
  game profile at the relocated path was silently lost with no visible error. The allow-list
  is now derived from the same mapping dict `_resolve_target` already consults, instead of
  maintaining two independently-reasoned path sets. Found via a full-file 9-agent review of
  `journal.py`/`utils.py` (2026-08-31, cross-file-contracts angle).
- 3 doc-drift corrections found by the same review: the FAQ pointed at a "Logs" tab (the real
  tab is "Diagnostics"); the Control Center doc's Preflight table implied `user_config`/
  `games_conf_dir` always show as their own passing row (they only surface as a failing one);
  the Backup & Recovery doc undersold `BACKUP_KEEP`'s guard (any value `<= 0` disables
  pruning, not just exactly `0`).
- `control_center.py`: the Diagnostics log filter (`log_search`) re-rendered the entire log
  view — clear + one `QTextEdit.append()` per surviving line, each triggering a document
  relayout — on every keystroke, a real stutter on a session left running for hours/days
  with a correspondingly large log volume. `textChanged` now (re)starts a single-shot
  `QTimer` (`_log_filter_timer`, 200ms) via the new `_schedule_log_filter` instead of
  rendering directly, collapsing a burst of keystrokes into one render. Found via the same
  full-file 8-agent review as the fixes above (2026-08-31).
- `backup.py`: `_ensure_backup_dir()`'s `mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` can raise
  `OSError` (permission denied, full disk, a path component that already exists as a file) —
  unlike every later step in `run_backup()`, this call ran unguarded and before
  `BACKUP_START` was even logged, so a failure crashed with a raw traceback instead of a
  clean, logged exit. A companion `fix_ownership()` call later in the function was initially
  flagged as a similar gap but turned out to be a false positive: `utils.fix_ownership()`
  already catches `(OSError, KeyError, SubprocessError)` internally and only WARNs, so it
  cannot actually raise — no change was needed there. Found via the same full-file 8-agent
  review as the fixes above (2026-08-31).
- `control_center.py`: `load_logs` was the only worker without a busy-guard, unlike
  `refresh_detected_games`/`_refresh_service_status` — `on_tab_changed` calls it
  unconditionally on every Diagnostics tab (re-)selection, so switching away and back while
  a `journalctl` fetch was still in flight could start a second worker, and whichever
  thread's `logs_ready` landed last silently overwrote the other's result. Added
  `_logs_busy`, same shape as the other two guards (CLAUDE.md checklist item 17). Found via
  the same full-file 8-agent review as the fixes above (2026-08-31).
- `restore.py`: `run_restore()` always logged `RESTORE_SUCCESS` and exited 0 regardless of
  how many archive members actually matched `get_backup_mapping()` — `verify_archive()` only
  checks gzip/tar integrity, not content, so a wrong tool's archive (or one from an
  incompatible layout) could pass it while restoring zero files, and Control Center's
  "Restore Complete — Restored!" dialog appeared even though nothing on disk changed.
  `_extract_payload()` now returns a restored-member count alongside the links entry;
  `_execute_restore()` logs `RESTORE_EMPTY` and exits 1 when that count is 0, which
  `_run_pkexec`'s existing error handling already surfaces as a "Restore Error" dialog.
  Found via the same full-file 8-agent review as the fixes above (2026-08-31).
- `utils.py`: `get_backup_mapping()` only ever mapped `user/config` (`~/.config/
  steamos_diy`), covering `games_conf_dir`'s default location (nested inside it) for free —
  but a `games_conf_dir` relocated via the SSoT (a supported, tested pattern per
  `control_center.py`'s `_resolve_config_paths`) got no mapping entry at all: backup silently
  skipped every game profile there, and restore had no key to put them back with even if
  they had been captured. Now adds a `user/games_conf_dir` entry whenever the resolved path
  differs from the default (`realpath`-compared to avoid a spurious diff from a symlink/
  trailing slash). Found via the same full-file 8-agent review as the two fixes above
  (2026-08-31).
- `control_center.py`: `validate_config`'s worker thread had no try/except at all — the only
  one in the file without it — so an uncaught exception killed it before it could emit
  anything: no dialog, no log, the "Validate Configuration" button visibly doing nothing.
  Root cause was in `health.py`: `_check_yaml`/`_read_user_config` caught `(OSError,
  YAMLError)` but not `UnicodeDecodeError`, raised by the text-mode `open()` itself — before
  ruamel ever sees the bytes — on a config file saved with non-UTF-8 encoding. Same failure
  mode as the aware/naive datetime crash in `journal.py` earlier this cycle: the app is
  launched detached with stderr to `/dev/null`, so an uncaught background-thread exception
  is completely invisible. Both `health.py` except clauses now also catch
  `UnicodeDecodeError` (fixes it for every caller, including `export_support_log`), and
  `validate_config`'s worker now has a defensive try/except matching every sibling worker in
  the file, emitting `process_finished` on failure instead of dying silently. Found via a
  full-file 8-agent review of `control_center.py`/`backup.py`/`restore.py`/`health.py`
  (2026-08-31).
- `sdy.py`: `games_conf_dir`'s fallback (used only when the SSoT key is unset) hardcoded
  `/etc/steamos_diy/games.d` — a directory `install.sh` never creates and nothing else in the
  repo references, i.e. a dead path. `control_center.py` falls back to
  `~/.config/steamos_diy/games.d` instead, so on an installation with a missing/corrupted
  `games_conf_dir` key, the GUI would save per-game profiles to a directory the launcher would
  never look in — same silent-divergence risk as the `user_config`/`games_conf_dir` SSoT bug
  fixed in 2.1.7, but on the fallback value rather than the SSoT-read value. Now resolves via
  the new `utils.default_games_conf_dir()`, matching `control_center.py`'s actual default.
- `utils.py`: `download_release()` used to prune every previously-cached release download
  (`_prune_downloads()`) *before* verifying the new download's checksum. A corrupted or
  tampered-with download that failed `_download_verified_tarball()`'s SHA-256 check would
  abort correctly, but the last known-good cached release had already been deleted — a
  successful earlier update's cache was destroyed by an unrelated failed one. Pruning now
  runs only after the new tarball is downloaded and verified, immediately before extraction.
- `control_center.py`: `_run_pkexec`'s re-entrancy guard (`_pkexec_busy`) had two related gaps.
  First, replacing its old unconditional `finally:` reset with a `TimeoutExpired`-only skip
  meant *any* unforeseen exception in the worker (e.g. a cross-thread Qt signal emit racing
  window teardown) — not just the deliberate timeout case — could leave the guard silently
  stuck forever with no error shown; a `finally` guarded by a local flag now resets it on
  every outcome except the intentional timeout. Second, the guard was a single flag shared by
  three unrelated privileged operations (journal vacuum, backup, restore), so a timeout on
  vacuum (which touches no files backup/restore care about) permanently blocked the other two
  as well; it's now keyed per lock group (`lock_key="files"` for Backup/Restore, which do
  share target files and must stay mutually exclusive, `lock_key="vacuum"` for journal
  cleanup, which doesn't) so unrelated operations no longer block each other.
- `control_center.py`: `_resolve_config_paths`'s `games_conf_dir` fallback independently
  hardcoded the `"games.d"` subdirectory name instead of sharing it with
  `utils.default_games_conf_dir()` (the function whose own docstring already claimed to be
  the single source of truth for both files) — today's values happened to coincide, but
  nothing would have caught the two silently diverging if either literal were ever edited
  alone, the same class of bug already fixed once for this exact concept earlier in this
  release. Both now derive from a single shared `utils.GAMES_CONF_SUBDIR` constant.
- `journal.py`: `_split_gamescope_line` stripped the timezone off its parsed timestamp
  (`.replace(tzinfo=None)`) while `_finalize_export_entry`'s timestamps stayed timezone-aware.
  `control_center.py`'s `load_logs()` merges and sorts both lists together for the default
  `ALL` tag (and `STEAM`), so a real session with any gamescope activity raised an uncaught
  `TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes` inside the worker
  thread — not covered by the surrounding `except (subprocess.SubprocessError, OSError)`, so
  it died silently and the Diagnostics tab stayed stuck on "Loading logs..." forever. Found
  live on a real gamescope session (no prior test merged both entry sources).
  `journalctl -o short-iso` already includes the UTC offset, so dropping the
  `.replace(tzinfo=None)` call is sufficient — both sources now stay aware.
- `steamos_diy_core.c`: first full manual review of the C source (checklist items 1/6/7,
  pre-checked by `scripts/audit-c-core.sh`/`scripts/audit-ctypes-abi.py`) found and fixed
  four issues in `c_write_atomic`/`c_sd_notify_ready`. Most notably, `c_write_atomic`'s
  `rename()` was never followed by an `fsync()` on the containing directory — the rename
  itself is atomic, but the directory-entry update it makes isn't guaranteed durable across
  a power loss before that directory's own journal entry flushes, on the same handheld
  power-loss threat model already documented for subprocess timeout discipline. It now
  best-effort `fsync()`s the parent directory (handles both nested and single-level-under-
  root paths) after a successful rename. Also: `c_sd_notify_ready()`'s empty `()` parameter
  list (unspecified-argument C, not true zero-argument) is now `(void)`; its `sendto()` call
  hardcoded the length of `"READY=1"` as the literal `7` instead of `strlen(msg)`; and a
  comment now documents that `c_write_atomic` always creates its target with mode `0644`
  regardless of the file's previous permissions (inherent to tmp+rename, harmless today
  since no caller writes a permission-sensitive file through it). All four verified by
  compiling `libcore.so` and exercising every function directly via `ctypes` (including a
  real abstract `AF_UNIX` socket round-trip for `c_sd_notify_ready`), since this file has no
  automated test coverage (`conftest.py` mocks `ctypes.CDLL` for the Python suite). CLAUDE.md
  gained a "Confirmed-intentional design decisions" entry for `gcc -fanalyzer`'s unrelated
  `%m`/`-Wformat` non-ISO-C warning on the same `syslog()` call (valid glibc extension, this
  project only targets glibc distros) so it isn't re-flagged as a finding in future audits.
- `session_launch.py`: `_schedule_post_start_cmds` reimplemented shlex parsing with raw
  `shlex.split`/skip-on-`ValueError` instead of reusing `shlex_split_or_fallback` — already
  imported and used two functions above it for the structurally identical `flags` field, and
  already the documented contract this test file's own docstring claimed for *both* fields.
  A malformed `post_start_cmds` entry silently skipped the whole command; the identical typo
  in `flags` degraded to a naive `str.split()` and still ran. Now both fields share the same
  degrade-and-run behavior. Found independently by 3 of 8 review agents in the second
  extended code-review pass (reuse, cross-file, and architecture angles).
- `sdy.py`: `_resolve_effective_name`'s "rightmost existing absolute path in argv" heuristic
  could pick a trailing directory argument (e.g. a `--workshop-dir /path/to/workshop` value)
  instead of the actual game binary, since it only checked `os.path.exists`, not that the
  candidate was a file. The per-game profile lookup then silently missed, falling back to
  the global config with no error. Now requires `os.path.isfile`, which keeps the
  intentional "skip past a wrapper like mangohud earlier in argv" behavior (already pinned
  by an existing test) while excluding directories.
- `session_launch.py`: removed `_run_session`'s `except subprocess.SubprocessError` clause —
  every subprocess call reachable inside the surrounding `try` block already catches its own
  `TimeoutExpired` internally (`_monitor_process`, `_terminate_gracefully`), and nothing
  calls `.run(check=True)`/`.check_call()`/`.check_output()`, so `CalledProcessError` was
  never possible either. The clause was logically dead code — reachable per syntax, never
  per actual call pattern — the exact class of issue `vulture` can't catch since it only
  flags unreferenced code, not unreachable branches. No behavior change.
- `session_launch.py`: `_terminate_gracefully`'s final `proc.wait()` after escalating to
  `SIGKILL` had no timeout, so a child stuck in uninterruptible I/O (D-state — a real
  possibility on a handheld with a flaky storage/USB glitch) could block it indefinitely,
  in turn blocking `_handle_term`'s `sys.exit(0)`. Now bounded by the same `TERM_TIMEOUT`
  used for the SIGTERM wait; if still alive after that, logs `SIGKILL_TIMEOUT` and returns
  rather than hanging — `systemd`'s own `KillMode=mixed` + `TimeoutStopSec` backstop reaps
  the cgroup regardless, so this only affects how promptly the caller's own shutdown/
  recovery flow can proceed, not whether the process eventually goes away.
- `sdy.py`: `run()`'s docstring states "Exits with 1 on failure; never returns on success,"
  but the `len(sys.argv) < 2` guard did a plain `return` — neither outcome. Now exits 1 with
  a logged `NO_TARGET` reason, matching the documented contract.
- `docs/SteamMachine DIY Control Center.md`: the Diagnostics styling table listed `/` among
  the characters highlighted red/bold in the YAML editor; `editors.py`'s actual regex only
  matches `:` and `-` (deliberately — `/` appears in nearly every path value in this
  project's config, so highlighting it would make paths unreadable rather than clearer).
  Corrected the table to match the code.
- `utils.py`: `get_backup_mapping()`'s `user/config` entry was hardcoded to
  `~/.config/steamos_diy`, unlike `games_conf_dir`'s entry above (fixed 2026-08-26), which
  already resolves dynamically via the SSoT. A `user_config` relocated to a different
  directory (a supported, tested pattern — see CLAUDE.md's confirmed-intentional note on
  `control_center.py`'s Global Options tab) caused `backup.py` to silently archive the
  stale default directory instead of the live one; restoring that archive left the user's
  actual active config untouched, with no error anywhere in the flow. Now resolves the
  same way `control_center.py::_resolve_config_paths` already does, via a new shared
  `CONFIG_FILE_NAME` constant so the two can't independently drift on the fallback value.
  Also fixes a latent interaction this exposed: the check for whether `games_conf_dir` is
  "already nested under user/config, backed up for free" compared against the *fixed*
  default directory, not the actual (now possibly relocated) `user/config` entry — a
  `games_conf_dir` left at its own default while `user_config` alone moved elsewhere would
  have silently dropped out of the backup too. Replaced the equality check with a real
  nesting check against the resolved `user/config` directory. Found via a dedicated
  cross-file-contracts review across the full 11-file production `.py` tree (2026-09-01).
- `restore.py`: `_restore_link` recreated a symlink via `os.unlink()` then `os.symlink()`
  as two separate syscalls, unlike every other write path in this file (`_write_member`
  already goes tmp+`os.replace()`). A kill between the two calls — plausible given
  `control_center.py`'s own 300s pkexec timeout, or a handheld losing power mid-restore —
  left the symlink missing entirely rather than stale, silently dropping a critical shim
  (e.g. a session-select polkit helper) with no log of the gap. Now creates the new
  symlink at a temp path first, then `os.replace()`s it onto the real link path, mirroring
  `_write_member`'s existing pattern. Found via the same cross-file-contracts review as the
  fix above (2026-09-01).
- `restore.py`: `_extract_member`'s `os.chmod()` call was the only step not wrapped in its
  own error handling — an `OSError` there (e.g. a race where the target is removed or has
  its permissions changed between `_write_member`'s `os.replace()` and this `chmod`)
  propagated all the way up into `_execute_restore`'s archive-level `except`, which exits 1
  and aborts the *entire* restore — contradicting `run_restore`'s own docstring, which
  promises per-member rejections are logged but non-fatal, and inconsistent with every
  other per-member failure path in this file (symlink guards, allow-list checks), which
  already degrades gracefully. Now logs `RESTORE_CHMOD_FAIL` and returns `False` for that
  member only, same as the others. Found via the same cross-file-contracts review as the
  two fixes above (2026-09-01).
- `control_center.py`: `self.conf_root`/`self.games_conf_dir` were resolved once in
  `__init__` and never revisited. A restore that relocates the SSoT's `user_config`/
  `games_conf_dir` keys runs as a separate `pkexec`'d process, so it can't invalidate
  Control Center's in-process `get_ssot_var()` cache — without an explicit
  `clear_ssot_cache()`, the paths stayed pointed at the stale pre-restore location until
  the app was restarted, silently misdirecting any Global Options/Game Overrides save made
  right after a restore. `_show_completion_message` now clears the SSoT cache and
  re-resolves both paths whenever a privileged operation completes without error — also
  fires harmlessly for backup/vacuum/validate/export success, where the SSoT never
  changes (a cheap re-read of a small file, not a hot path). Found via the same
  cross-file-contracts review as the three fixes above (2026-09-01).
- `control_center.py`: every daemon-worker `signal.emit()` call lacked the `RuntimeError`
  guard `updater.py`'s own workers already have. Closing Control Center while a privileged
  operation is still in flight (Backup/Restore can run for up to the 300s pkexec budget)
  deletes the underlying Qt object; emitting on it then raises `RuntimeError`, which
  propagated uncaught out of the worker thread — silently, since stderr is `/dev/null` when
  the app is launched detached, the same silent-vanish class already hardened elsewhere.
  Added a shared `_safe_emit(signal, *args)` helper and routed all 13 emit() call sites
  through it (`_run_pkexec`'s worker, `validate_config`, `refresh_detected_games`,
  `load_logs`, `export_support_log`, `_refresh_service_status`). Found via the same
  cross-file-contracts review as the fixes above (2026-09-01).
- `control_center.py`: "Switch to Steam", "Open Konsole Terminal", and "Browse Config
  Folder" all discarded `spawn_native()`'s return value, unlike `updater.py`'s own call to
  the same function (which checks `pid == 0` and shows a warning). A missing binary or
  broken `PATH` made the button click silently do nothing, with zero user-visible feedback.
  Added a small `_launch_or_warn(bin_path, argv)` wrapper and routed all 3 call sites
  through it. Found via the same cross-file-contracts review as the fixes above
  (2026-09-01).
- `utils.py`/`restore.py`: `get_backup_mapping()`'s `"user/games_conf_dir"` entry was only
  added when the *current* system's `games_conf_dir` diverges from its default nesting
  under `user/config` — correct for `backup.py` (avoids double-archiving), but `restore.py`
  computed its own mapping the same way, using the current pre-restore SSoT state rather
  than whatever state the archive was actually made under. This matters for the real
  backup/restore use case: a "parachute" restore after a from-scratch OS reinstall (system
  failure, not a project update) lands back on the default SSoT, but the archive being
  restored may have been made while `games_conf_dir` was relocated (e.g. to an SD card) —
  the archive's member names are fixed at backup time regardless of the current system's
  state, so without a matching mapping key those per-game override files were silently
  dropped on restore, with no error since other members still matched. `get_backup_mapping()`
  gained a `for_restore` keyword: when set, the entry is always included (a harmless no-op
  match when the archive's own `games_conf_dir` was nested, the common case) — `backup.py`'s
  own call is unaffected, and `restore.py`'s `_prepare_restore` now passes
  `for_restore=True`. `system/next_session` was left as-is (a fixed system path, not a
  user-facing "where are my files" setting, so not similarly relocation-sensitive in
  practice). Found via a dedicated cross-file-contracts review across the full 11-file
  production `.py` tree (2026-09-01).
- `control_center.py`: `toggle_template` never disabled the target combo
  (`combo_global_files`/`combo_games`) while a template preview was showing. Switching the
  target file mid-preview fired `load_global_file`/`load_game_file` (wired to the combo's
  own change signal) while `is_template`/`cache` still tracked the PREVIOUS file; exiting
  template mode afterwards restored that stale cache over the newly-selected file, and a
  subsequent Save silently wrote it to the wrong path — real data corruption of a game or
  global config profile. `_template_widgets_for` now also returns the context's target
  combo, disabled for the duration of the preview in `_enter_template_mode` and re-enabled
  in `_exit_template_mode`. Found via a second full-file review pass across the same
  11-file production tree (2026-09-02).
- `restore.py`: `_write_member`'s `os.makedirs`/`shutil.copyfileobj`/`os.replace` calls had
  no try/except at all. Any `OSError` there (e.g. a crafted archive member whose target's
  parent path collides with an existing file from another mapping key, or `ENOSPC`
  mid-copy) escaped all the way to `_execute_restore`'s archive-level `except`, aborting
  the ENTIRE restore — contradicting `run_restore`'s own documented per-member-isolation
  contract ("Per-member rejections are logged but non-fatal"). Now wrapped in
  `try/except OSError`, logs `RESTORE_WRITE_FAIL`, returns `False`, same pattern already
  used by `_restore_link` and `_extract_member`'s chmod guard. Found via the second
  full-file review pass, cross-confirmed independently by 2 different agents (2026-09-02).
- `utils.py`: `_load_ssot_cache()` only caught `OSError` while iterating the SSoT file,
  unlike its siblings `read_session_target`/`load_yaml_safe` (both already catch
  `UnicodeDecodeError` too). Since `get_ssot_var()` is called from virtually every module
  (including `jlog()` itself), a hand-edited SSoT conf saved with a non-UTF-8 byte would
  crash the very first `get_ssot_var()` call anywhere instead of degrading. Now also
  catches `UnicodeDecodeError`. Found via the second full-file review pass (2026-09-02).
- `control_center.py`: `load_global_file`, `load_game_file`, and `_enter_template_mode`
  all called `Path.read_text(encoding="utf-8")` with zero try/except, unlike every other
  hand-edited-file reader in this codebase. A non-UTF-8 game profile or global config (or
  a TOCTOU delete after the `exists()` check) crashed the load with an uncaught exception
  out of a Qt slot instead of degrading. All three now catch `(OSError, UnicodeDecodeError)`
  and show a status-bar message, matching `beautify_yaml`'s existing lightweight degrade
  pattern. Found via the second full-file review pass (2026-09-02).
- `backup.py`: `get_ssot_num()` already degrades a non-numeric SSoT value, but `"nan"`/
  `"inf"` parse as valid floats (`float()` accepts them) — `int()` is what actually rejects
  them (`nan` raises `ValueError`, `inf` raises `OverflowError`), uncaught in
  `_prune_old_archives`. This runs AFTER `run_backup()` already logged `BACKUP_SUCCESS`, so
  the crash reported a false "Backup Error" for an archive that's actually fine. Now
  wrapped in `try/except (ValueError, OverflowError)`, degrades to `_BACKUP_KEEP_DEFAULT`
  with a `BAD_BACKUP_KEEP` warning log. Found via the second full-file review pass
  (2026-09-02).
- `control_center.py`: `refresh_detected_games`'s journalctl invocation had no `-n` line
  cap, unlike `journal.py`'s own bounded `get_journal_cmd()` pattern (`-n 300` with
  `--since "12 hours ago"`). Every "Scan History" click pulled the WHOLE 24h system
  journal unbounded, mostly discarded by the Python-side filter. Can't narrow by `-t` like
  `journal.py` does: the chdir/gameID/AppID lines `filter_game_journal_lines` looks for
  come from Steam/gamescope's own captured output, not this project's `jlog()` tags. Added
  `-n 5000` instead — generous enough to still catch real launches over 24h, but bounded.
  Found via the second full-file review pass (2026-09-02).
- `utils.py::get_backup_mapping`: a hand-edited `user_config` with no directory component
  (a bare `"config.yaml"`) made `os.path.dirname()` return `""`. Passed unmodified to
  `restore.py`'s `_allowed_prefixes`, `os.path.realpath("")` resolves to the process's
  CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY, silently widening the privileged (root, under `pkexec`)
  restore write allow-list to an unpredictable cwd instead of degrading to the default
  config dir. Now falls back to the default when `os.path.dirname()` returns empty,
  matching `get_ssot_num`'s own degrade-safely contract. Found via the second full-file
  review pass (2026-09-02).
- `session_launch.py`: `_schedule_post_start_cmds`'s daemon thread had no link to session
  outcome — it fired its configured commands even after `_monitor_process` detected an
  early crash and `_handle_recovery` had already switched to desktop. Added a
  `threading.Event`, set by `_run_session` the moment a crash is detected, checked by the
  daemon thread once after its delay elapses before firing anything. Found via the second
  full-file review pass (2026-09-02).
- `sdy.py`/`session_launch.py`: `os.execvpe` (`sdy.py::_exec_game`) and `subprocess.Popen`
  (`session_launch.py::_run_session`) both raise `ValueError`, not `OSError`, for an
  embedded null byte in argv (e.g. from a hand-edited `GAME_WRAPPER`/`GAME_EXTRA_ARGS`/
  `flags` entry) — uncaught by either function's `except OSError`, crashing the launch
  path with a raw traceback instead of the documented graceful degrade. Same
  "hand-edited config crashes the boot path" class already fixed repeatedly elsewhere.
  Found via the second full-file review pass (2026-09-02).
- `journal.py::filter_game_journal_lines`: `chdir_marker` had no trailing boundary
  character, so `home="/home/deck"` false-positive-matched a chdir into a DIFFERENT
  user's home, `"/home/deck2/..."`. Added a trailing `"/"`, same boundary reasoning
  already used by `restore.py::_allowed_prefixes` (`"/etcfoo"` must not match `"/etc"`).
  Found via the second full-file review pass (2026-09-02).
- `journal.py::parse_game_logs`: `pid = pid_match.group(1) if pid_match else ""` made
  every line lacking a `[pid]:` suffix share the SAME `cur_by_pid[""]` bucket,
  reintroducing the exact cross-attribution the pid-keyed tracking exists to prevent (per
  this function's own docstring) — just for pid-less lines instead of present ones. A
  pid-less NAME line still lands in `det` as a self-reference; a pid-less ID line is no
  longer attributed to any name. Found via the second full-file review pass (2026-09-02).
- `control_center.py::_update_game_combo_ui`: `combo_games.clear()` also resets the
  editable combo's line-edit text, not just its item list. A "Scan History" click
  finishing while the user was still typing a manually-added game's name wiped that text;
  a subsequent Save then silently no-oped on the now-empty `currentText()`. Now captures
  the typed text before clearing and restores it via `setEditText()` if it doesn't already
  match one of the freshly repopulated items. Found via the second full-file review pass
  (2026-09-02).
- `journal.py::parse_game_logs`: `_MIN_APPID_LEN = 3` discarded any ID under 3 digits as
  "noise", but `extract_game_metadata` only ever matches an ID after a literal
  `"gameID"`/`"AppID = "` token, and several of Valve's own early AppIDs are genuinely 1-2
  digits (10 = Counter-Strike, 20 = Team Fortress Classic, 70 = Half-Life, all still
  playable today). The filter silently dropped real journal-based launch detections for
  exactly those games instead of filtering actual noise. Removed the length floor. Found
  via the second full-file review pass (2026-09-02).
- `control_center.py::edit_ssot_privileged`: called `subprocess.Popen` directly, unlike
  the other 3 Maintenance-tab buttons (Switch to Steam/Konsole/Browse Config), which all
  route through `spawn_native`'s `start_new_session=True` detachment. Kate/KWrite stayed
  attached to Control Center's own process group instead of being properly detached. Now
  routed through `_launch_or_warn`/`spawn_native` like its siblings. Found via the second
  full-file review pass (2026-09-02).
- `control_center.py::export_support_log`: had no re-entrancy guard at all, unlike
  `refresh_detected_games`/`load_logs`'s established `_busy` pattern. The save dialog is
  modal, so this only mattered for two fast successive clicks picking the SAME
  destination — without a guard, two worker threads could race writing to that file with
  plain `write_text()` (not the atomic `write_atomic()` path, since this is a diagnostic
  export, not a config file). Found via the second full-file review pass (2026-09-02).
- 3 more doc/comment-drift corrections found by the same review: `docs/Backup &
  Recovery.md`'s link-reconstruction description still said restore recreates symlinks via
  a plain `os.symlink` call, unaware of this cycle's `_restore_link` atomicity fix;
  `control_center.py::_show_completion_message`'s comment listed "validate" among the ops
  that reach its cache-refresh code on success, but `validate_config` uses a separate
  `preflight_ready` signal on success and never reaches this method at all;
  `docs/Steamos Session Launch.md` stated `POST_START_DELAY < VALIDATION_TIMEOUT` as a
  guaranteed invariant when nothing in code enforces that relationship — replaced with a
  description of this cycle's actual crash-skip mechanism. Found via the second full-file
  review pass (2026-09-02).
- `sdy.py::_find_profile_by_id`: removed the unreachable `not appid` half of its guard —
  the sole call site (`_get_profile_path`) only invokes this function inside
  `if steam_appid:`, so that branch was dead code, not a real safety net. Found via the
  second full-file review pass (2026-09-02).
- `install.sh`: two real gaps found extending the full-file review methodology to the
  files deferred until this cycle (`install.sh`/`uninstall.sh`/`steamos_diy_core.c`,
  never reviewed at this depth before). `deploy_files()`: a plain (non `--update`) run on
  top of an already-installed system unconditionally overwrote the live SSoT config with
  the template, unlike the YAML config deploy step right below it which already prompts
  before overwriting — now gets the same confirm prompt. `setup_systemd_lockdown()`:
  masked `getty@tty1.service` *before* confirming `steamos_diy.service` was successfully
  deployed and enabled; under `set -eo pipefail` a missing service file or a failed
  `systemctl enable` left TTY1 masked with no working replacement. Reordered to mask
  Getty only after the replacement is confirmed enabled, matching the "confirm safe state
  first" discipline `uninstall.sh`'s own `cleanup_services()` already applies in reverse.
- `steamos_diy_core.c::c_write_atomic`: two gaps found by the same deferred-files review.
  `open(tmp_path, ...)` had no `O_NOFOLLOW`, unlike the equivalent Python-side TOCTOU
  guard already applied this cycle (`restore.py::_write_member`) — a symlink planted at
  `tmp_path` by another process running as the same user would be followed and written
  through instead of refused; no current caller crosses a privilege boundary, but this is
  an exported, generically-loaded primitive with no privilege check of its own, so it
  shouldn't rely on today's call graph to stay safe. `fdatasync(fd)`'s return value was
  discarded before `rename()`, unlike the function's own header comment promising
  "hardware durability" — now logs a `WARNING` via syslog on failure (matching the
  existing rename-failure log pattern) without changing control flow. Verified by
  rebuilding `libcore.so` with `install.sh`'s exact compile command, re-running
  `scripts/audit-c-core.sh`/`scripts/audit-ctypes-abi.py` (no ABI change), and a
  functional smoke test confirming normal writes still work and a symlinked tmp path is
  now refused without touching its target.
- `control_center.py::closeEvent`: a failed save (a YAML syntax error, or an `OSError` from
  `_atomic_save`) on the "Save before closing?" prompt still closed the window right after
  the save loop — `_atomic_save` swallows both exceptions internally (shows its own error
  dialog) and gives `closeEvent` no success/failure signal, so "Save" silently behaved like
  "Discard" whenever the save actually failed. Now re-checks `_dirty_editors()` after the
  save loop and calls `event.ignore()` if anything is still dirty, instead of accepting
  unconditionally. Found via a third full-file review pass (4 parallel agents, 2026-09-03).
- `session_launch.py`: `_schedule_post_start_cmds`'s docstring overclaimed its own crash
  guard — it only catches a crash within `[0, POST_START_DELAY]`, but `_monitor_process`
  keeps watching up to `VALIDATION_TIMEOUT`, longer than `POST_START_DELAY` under the
  shipped SSoT defaults (2.0s vs 5.0s). A crash in `(POST_START_DELAY, VALIDATION_TIMEOUT]`
  still fires `post_start_cmds` before recovery-to-desktop engages. Documented as a
  deliberately accepted tradeoff rather than fixed in code: closing it fully would delay
  every session's `post_start_cmds` up to `VALIDATION_TIMEOUT`, even when healthy, to guard
  against a narrow, low-harm edge case (stray command state on a session about to be
  recovered anyway — not data loss or a security issue). Found via a third full-file review
  pass (4 parallel agents, 2026-09-03).
- `install.sh`: the plain-reinstall SSoT confirm prompt's "decline overwrite" branch lost
  the `chmod 644` heal its `--update` sibling has, reproducing the 2.1.5 "SSoT unreadable"
  bug for anyone who answers "N" to the prompt on a legacy 0600 SSoT. Now heals the
  permissions regardless of the user's answer. Found via a third full-file review pass (4
  parallel agents, 2026-09-03), verified with a standalone smoke test of the branch logic.
- `steamos_diy_core.c::c_write_atomic`: two related gaps fixed together. It was `void`, so
  every failure (symlink refused, short write, failed rename) was only visible in syslog,
  never to the Python caller — `write_atomic()` now forwards the C side's int return as
  `bool`, and all 4 call sites react to `False` instead of assuming the write landed;
  `control_center.py::_atomic_save` is the one users actually see: it now reports a Save
  Error and leaves the document dirty instead of lying "Configuration saved!", which is
  also what makes the recent `closeEvent` fix effective for a C-level write failure, not
  just a Python-level `YAMLError`/`OSError`. Separately, `open()` on the tmp path had no
  `O_NONBLOCK`: a same-user process planting a FIFO there (same threat model as the
  existing `O_NOFOLLOW` symlink guard) blocked every caller forever waiting for a reader —
  `O_NONBLOCK` now makes a reader-less FIFO fail immediately (`ENXIO`), and a new
  `fstat`/`S_ISREG` check refuses the case where an attacker keeps a reader attached (which
  would otherwise let the FIFO get renamed onto the real config file). Verified functionally
  against a rebuilt `libcore.so`: normal write, overwrite, symlink attack, FIFO with no
  reader, and FIFO with an attached reader all behave as intended, none hang. Found via a
  third full-file review pass (4 parallel agents, 2026-09-03).
- `updater.py::_on_download`: called `self._set_idle()` unconditionally at the top, before
  the checksum re-verify and before Konsole/pkexec even launched — the "Check for Updates"
  button was clickable again well before the privileged install (a detached process this
  handler never awaits) actually finished, so a second click could start a second concurrent
  `pkexec install.sh --update` against the same files (checklist item 15). Now only re-idles
  on the failure paths (download failed, verify failed, spawn failed); on success it stays
  disabled with an "Installing..." label since a reboot is imminent. Found via a third
  full-file review pass (4 parallel agents, 2026-09-03).
- `health.py::_check_binaries`: `os.access(path, os.X_OK)` alone is true for a traversable
  directory, not just an executable file — a SSoT `bin_*` key mistakenly pointed at a
  directory passed this preflight as "OK" even though `session_launch.py` can't actually
  exec it. Now also requires `os.path.isfile()`. Found via a third full-file review pass (4
  parallel agents, 2026-09-03).
- `uninstall.sh`: had no guard against an unresolved `USER_HOME`, unlike `install.sh`'s
  mirror-image check. A stale/invalid `SUDO_USER` left `USER_HOME` empty, so `user_cfg`
  became `/.config/steamos_diy` and the "delete user data" step silently targeted an
  unintended root-level path instead of failing loudly. Now exits with an error, matching
  `install.sh`. Found via a third full-file review pass (4 parallel agents, 2026-09-03).
- `updater.py`: `_download`'s bare `# noqa: BLE001` on its broad-except lacked the one-line
  justification CLAUDE.md's suppression-comment discipline requires. Added: an uncaught
  exception in this daemon thread's worker would skip the `.emit()` below it entirely,
  leaving the update button stuck on "Downloading..." forever with nothing printed. Found
  via a third full-file review pass (4 parallel agents, 2026-09-03).
- `health.py::_check_gamescope_flags`: built an "allowed flags" set by text-parsing
  `gamescope --help`, then diffed the configured flags against it — but gamescope accepts
  some flags it never documents in `--help` (found live on real hardware: `--fade-out-duration`
  is used successfully in every real launch, yet the preflight always flagged it
  "unrecognised"). Now runs the configured flags through gamescope's own parser
  (`gamescope <flags> --help`) and checks its own error output instead of reimplementing one
  — exactly as side-effect-free as before (`--help` still exits immediately without touching
  display/DRM), and simpler code (removes `_gamescope_options()`/`_collect_unknown_flags()`
  entirely). `getopt_long` stops at the first bad option, so only the first one is ever
  reported per run — still strictly better than false-flagging a valid flag. Verified against
  a real installed gamescope (3.16.28): a config using `--fade-out-duration` now passes, a
  genuinely invalid flag is still correctly rejected. Found during a real-hardware test round
  (2026-09-03).
- **Docs**: `journalctl -u steamos_diy.service` was documented (Troubleshooting, Zero DM
  Setup, FAQ wiki pages) as showing the session launcher's own logs, including crash
  recovery — it never did. `PAMName=login` moves the process into its own login-session
  cgroup (`user-<uid>.slice/session-N.scope`), and journald attributes a `syslog()`-sent
  message's unit from the sender's *current* cgroup, so every `jlog()` line (`CORE`/`STEAM`/
  `SYSTEM`, including `EARLY_EXIT_RECOVERY`) is filed under that session scope instead —
  `-u` only ever showed systemd's own start/stop/restart lines. The `sdy-errors` diagnostic
  alias built on `-u ... --priority=3` was consequently dead on arrival: it could never match
  a real application error. All three docs pages now lead with `journalctl -t CORE -t STEAM
  -t SYSTEM` and explain why `-u` alone misses everything; the alias now filters on the same
  tags. Found and confirmed live on real hardware while deliberately testing the two
  crash-recovery paths in `session_launch.py` (`kill -9` on gamescope before vs. after
  `VALIDATED_STEAM_STABLE`) — both recovery paths themselves worked exactly as designed, only
  the documented way to *see* that in the journal was wrong (2026-09-07).

### Performance
- `restore.py`: `_write_member`'s `dest.write(src.read())` loaded an archive member's entire
  content into memory before writing it out. Backups can include large user-data blobs
  (Steam config/state, save data) via `get_backup_mapping` — now streams via
  `shutil.copyfileobj(src, dest)` instead, same end result, avoiding an allocation
  proportional to file size on a resource-constrained handheld. Found via the same full-file
  8-agent review as the fixes above (2026-08-31).
- `utils.py`: deferred the `tarfile`/`shutil` imports (used only by backup/restore
  verification and the self-update path) to their actual call sites, so every other importer
  of this module — `session_launch.py` on the boot-critical session-switch path included —
  no longer pays their load cost for nothing. Follows the pattern already established for
  `urllib`/`json`/`hashlib`. Measured: `utils.py`'s cumulative import time dropped from ~55ms
  to ~45ms (`python3 -X importtime`, 3-run average); a real but modest win against a
  session-switch latency whose felt component (~4s) is otherwise dominated by third-party
  gamescope/Steam startup, not by this project's own code.

### Changed
- 3 minor cleanups from the full-file 9-agent review of `session_launch.py`/
  `session_select.py`/`sdy.py`/`editors.py`/`updater.py` (2026-08-31), all pure refactors
  with no behavior change: `sdy.py::_resolve_effective_name`'s `os.path.abspath(raw_args[0])`
  ran unconditionally as `next()`'s default argument (Python has no lazy-default machinery)
  even when the generator immediately matched and the fallback was discarded unused — now
  only computed when actually needed; `sdy.py::_get_profile_path` checked the same candidate
  path twice whenever `eff_name == stem` (the common case for a normally-named game binary),
  deduped with `dict.fromkeys()`; `"/usr/bin/konsole"` (independently hardcoded in
  `updater.py` and `control_center.py`, already in agreement) centralized into a new
  `utils.KONSOLE_BIN` constant, matching the existing `SYSTEMCTL_BIN`/`JOURNALCTL_BIN`/
  `PYTHON3_BIN` pattern.
- `control_center.py`: collapsed 3 independently-retyped `[PYTHON3_BIN, CORE_LIB_DIR/<script>,
  *args]` argv constructions (for `session_select.py`, `backup.py`, `restore.py` — all in the
  same file, each hardcoding `"/usr/bin/python3"` separately) into a shared
  `_core_script_argv()` helper and a new `utils.PYTHON3_BIN` constant, matching the existing
  `SYSTEMCTL_BIN`/`JOURNALCTL_BIN` centralization pattern. Pure DRY refactor, no behavior
  change. Found via the same full-file 8-agent review as the fixes above (2026-08-31).
- `utils.py`: added `shlex_split_or_fallback()` — the "`shlex.split`, degrade to `str.split()`
  on an unbalanced quote" pattern was independently reimplemented in `sdy.py` (`_safe_split`),
  `session_launch.py` (the gamescope `flags` loop) and `health.py`
  (`_collect_unknown_flags`) instead of sharing one copy. This is the exact class of code that
  already caused a real crash in this project (the unguarded `shlex.split` fixed in 2.1.7) — a
  future hardening of the fallback logic would otherwise need three independent edits instead
  of one. `session_launch.py`'s `_schedule_post_start_cmds` initially kept its own inline
  `shlex.split`/`continue`-on-failure handling unchanged; that divergence was itself unified
  onto `shlex_split_or_fallback()`'s shared degrade-and-run contract later in this same
  release (see the entry above).
- `utils.py`: `check_latest_release()`, `_fetch_expected_sha256()`, and
  `_download_verified_tarball()` each independently rebuilt the same
  `urllib.request.Request`/`urlopen(timeout=...)` plumbing and the same "reject a non-https
  URL" guard. Both are now centralized — `_https_open()` for the request/urlopen/timeout
  boilerplate, `_require_https()` for the scheme guard — while each caller keeps its own
  error handling, since what counts as recoverable (and what to log) genuinely differs per
  caller (JSON parsing vs. raw digest text vs. streamed binary). `_fetch_expected_sha256()`'s
  digest parsing/validation was also simplified from a double `str.split()` call plus a
  hand-rolled per-character hex-alphabet loop to a single `re.fullmatch()` check.
- `utils.py`: `fix_ownership`'s failure log (including the new timeout case above) moved from
  `DEBUG` to `WARN` — a failed/timed-out `chown -R` after a backup/restore run leaves files
  owned by root, which previously left zero trace in the journal under the default
  `LOG_LEVEL=INFO`.
- `backup.py` / `journal.py`: two previously-silent failure paths now log. `backup.py`'s
  `_collect_symlinks` logs `BACKUP_SYMLINK_SCAN_FAIL` (WARN) if a symlink-search directory
  can't be scanned, instead of silently omitting those symlinks from the backup manifest with
  no trace. `journal.py`'s `_run_journalctl_iso` logs `GAMESCOPE_LOG_FETCH_FAIL` (WARN) if the
  gamescope-log `journalctl` call fails, instead of returning an empty result indistinguishable
  from "no gamescope activity in the last hour" — this required `journal.py` to start
  importing `jlog` from `utils.py`, the only production file that previously imported nothing
  from it.
- Suppression-comment justification pass: every bare `# nosec`, `# pylint: disable`, and
  `# shellcheck disable` marker across the codebase now carries the same one-line reason its
  more prominent siblings already had (see `session_launch.py`'s existing `# nosec B404`/
  `# nosec B603` pattern) — no behavior change, but a bare suppression is no longer
  indistinguishable from an unreviewed one on a future read.
- `utils.py`: added `SYSTEMCTL_BIN`/`JOURNALCTL_BIN` constants — `/usr/bin/systemctl` was
  hardcoded identically in `health.py` and `restore.py`, and `/usr/bin/journalctl` in
  `journal.py` (twice) and `control_center.py` (twice). Unlike the `DEFAULT_*_BIN` group these
  aren't SSoT-backed: every systemd distro ships them at this fixed path, so there's no
  legitimate per-deployment override — this is a same-file-concept centralization, not a new
  user-facing config knob.
- `utils.py`: added `require_ssot_conf(tag)` — `backup.py` and `restore.py` each independently
  checked `os.path.isfile(SSOT_CONF_PATH)` and exited with an identical `jlog`+`sys.exit(1)`
  pattern, differing only in the log tag (`BACKUP_FAILED`/`RESTORE_FAILED`). Both now call the
  shared helper. `restore.py`'s legacy `restore_links.sh` line parser also gained a comment
  explaining why it deliberately skips a malformed line via a bare `shlex.split()`/`except
  ValueError` instead of the shared `shlex_split_or_fallback()`: a degraded `str.split()` there
  could pair the wrong link/target and recreate a bogus symlink, worse than skipping the entry.
- `utils.py`: added `safe_emit(signal, *args)` — `control_center.py`'s `_safe_emit` (swallow
  `RuntimeError` from emitting on a torn-down window) was reimplemented inline in
  `updater.py`'s two workers instead of reused, since `updater.py` is imported *by*
  `control_center.py` and couldn't import it back without a cycle. Moved to `utils.py`, which
  both already import from; every call site updated. Found via a full periodic
  KISS/centralization audit re-run (2026-09-03, first full re-run since 2026-08-26) — a
  second candidate from the same audit (4 identically-shaped busy-guard flags in
  `control_center.py`, crossing the "extract only if a third appears" threshold a prior audit
  set) was reviewed and deliberately left alone: the guard itself is 3 obvious lines per site,
  and a shared helper would need `getattr`/`setattr` on string attribute names to save very
  little, plus one site (`export_support_log`) sets its flag after a synchronous dialog rather
  than before, unlike the other three.
- `session_launch.py`: raises the process's open-file soft limit toward 524288 before
  spawning gamescope+Steam (`_raise_nofile_limit`, called from `_build_gamescope_args`) —
  matches a `ulimit -n 524288` real SteamOS's own `gamescope-session` launcher applies before
  Steam, found by comparing against a mounted real Deck recovery image. The systemd-managed
  session normally starts at the systemd-default 1024 soft limit even though the hard limit is
  already 524288 on a modern distro, so Proton/games with heavy shader-cache or asset I/O can
  hit that ceiling under normal use even though the headroom to avoid it already exists.
  Deliberately conservative: only ever raises (never lowers a soft limit a user or distro
  already set higher via `limits.conf`/a unit override), never exceeds the existing hard
  limit, and never aborts the session if the call fails for any reason.

## [2.1.7] — 2026-08-25 — Session Reliability & Regression Suite

### Added
- **Test suite**: `usr/local/lib/steamos_diy/tests/` — the project's first automated tests (84 cases, run with `pytest` from the repo root; scoped via the root `pyproject.toml`). Deliberately small and targeted rather than exhaustive: covers the fiddly pure logic in `backup.py` (path exclusion, archive pruning, symlink-manifest generation, plus an end-to-end `run_backup()` smoke test against a real `.tar.gz`), `restore.py`'s allow-list/traversal safety, and a regression test for every bug fixed below. `conftest.py` mocks `ctypes.CDLL` before any test imports `utils.py` (no `libcore.so` required to run the suite) and isolates the SSoT cache/`os.environ` per test so nothing touches the real `/etc/default/steamos_diy.conf`. `control_center.py`'s `_resolve_config_paths` was extracted as a pure function specifically so its SSoT-resolution logic (see Fixed, below) is testable without a `QApplication`. A follow-up pass added: `sdy.py`'s AppID/effective-name/stem profile-resolution precedence (pins the exact-match contract behind the 2.1.4 substring-match fix); a `get_backup_mapping()` ↔ `restore.py` symmetry check that round-trips every real backup key through the actual allow-list, so a future path relocation that breaks restore is caught immediately instead of silently; `get_ssot_num`'s malformed-value fallback; and — the highest-value addition — `session_launch.py`'s crash-detection/recovery-to-Desktop path (`_monitor_process`, `_terminate_gracefully`, `_run_session`), exercised against real short-lived subprocesses rather than mocks, since that mechanism is what decides whether the machine self-heals from a crash or is left with a black TTY1. A later pass added `health.py`'s `_check_groups` stale-gid isolation, `control_center.py`'s combo display-name parsing, and `journal.py`'s per-process AppID attribution (see Fixed, below), plus two previously-uncovered areas: `session_select.py`'s target-resolution keyword matching and its persist-state-before-spawn ordering (state must survive a helper-spawn failure so the next boot still has a valid target), and `utils.py`'s self-update path — `_version_tuple`/`_release_from_api` parsing, `_prune_downloads`, and `download_release()`'s HTTPS-only guardrail plus a full extract-and-locate-`install.sh` round-trip against a real in-memory release tarball, since this is the single highest-risk supply-chain surface in the project (the downloaded tarball's own `install.sh` later runs with elevated privileges).

### Fixed
- `session_launch.py` / `sdy.py`: an unbalanced quote in a hand-edited `flags:`/`post_start_cmds:`/`GAME_WRAPPER`/`GAME_EXTRA_ARGS` entry raised an uncaught `ValueError` from `shlex.split` — for `session_launch.py` this happened before any crash-recovery logic could engage, so the whole Game Mode launcher died, `Restart=on-failure` retried the same broken config, and the unit went to `failed` after `StartLimitBurst` with TTY1 stuck and no fallback to Desktop; for `sdy.py` the game simply never launched. `health.py`'s own preflight already guarded the same `shlex.split` call and degraded to `str.split()` on failure — the runtime paths now do the same instead of crashing.
- `restore.py`: `_write_member` wrote extracted files by `unlink()`-ing the target then `open(..., "wb")`, so a crash or power loss mid-restore could leave a system-critical file (the SSoT conf, the systemd unit) missing or truncated with no rollback. Rewritten to write to a `.sdy_restore_tmp` file and `os.replace()` it into place — atomic, and (like `backup.py`'s own archive write) `os.replace()` still sidesteps `ETXTBSY` on a currently-running binary by swapping the directory entry instead of truncating in place.
- `control_center.py`: the Global Options and Game Overrides tabs always read/wrote `~/.config/steamos_diy/...`, ignoring a customised `user_config`/`games_conf_dir` in the SSoT — `sdy.py` and `health.py` already resolved both dynamically, so a user who set either override would have the GUI "successfully" save edits to a file the session launcher never reads again, with no error surfaced. `conf_root`/`games_conf_dir` are now resolved from the SSoT the same way, via the new `_resolve_config_paths` helper.
- `control_center.py`: the Backup and Restore buttons (and journal vacuum) had no re-entrancy guard — a double-click, or Restore started while a Backup was still running, could launch two privileged `pkexec` operations writing the same files concurrently. `_run_pkexec` now tracks a `_pkexec_busy` flag and rejects a second invocation with a status-bar message until the first completes.
- `journal.py`: `_consume_export_line` parsed `__REALTIME_TIMESTAMP=` with a bare `int()`/`fromtimestamp()`, unlike every other malformed-input path in the same file (`_split_gamescope_line` already guards its parsing); a corrupted/truncated journal entry raised an uncaught `ValueError`. It now falls back to the existing "missing timestamp" path (`datetime.now()`), same as if the field were absent. Separately, `fetch_tagged_entries`/`_run_journalctl_iso` now decode `journalctl`'s output with `errors="replace"` — a `MESSAGE` field containing an embedded newline flips `journalctl -o export` to binary-safe encoding, which isn't guaranteed valid UTF-8, and `subprocess.run(text=True)` decoding that could otherwise raise `UnicodeDecodeError` — a type neither `control_center.py` `except` clause around these calls catches, leaving the Diagnostics tab stuck on "Loading logs..." indefinitely.
- `install.sh`: added `pipefail` (was plain `set -e`) and two related fixes it exposed. `USER_HOME=$(getent passwd ... | cut -d: -f6)` could silently resolve to an empty string if `getent` failed — under plain `set -e` a failing pipeline's exit status is only the *last* command's (`cut`, which "succeeds" on empty input), so the installer would carry on patching every user-space path with a missing `$HOME`; it now fails loudly with a clear error if `USER_HOME` comes back empty. Conversely, `GPU_INFO=$(lspci | grep -iE "vga|3d controller")` could abort the *entire* installer under `set -e` if `lspci`'s output didn't match either pattern (an exotic/unrecognised GPU) — now guarded with `|| true` so an unrecognised GPU degrades to the existing "skipping driver-specific packages" warning instead of a bare, unexplained installer death.
- `install.sh`: `cp -rf usr/local/lib/steamos_diy/* "$LIB_DIR/"` deployed the new `tests/` directory (added in this same release) onto every installed system — dev-only content with no business on a target machine, and `pytest` isn't a runtime dependency. Now removed with `rm -rf "$LIB_DIR/tests"` right after the copy.
- `utils.py`: `download_release()`'s nested `with urlopen(...): with tarfile.open(...):` merged into a single `with` statement (ruff SIM117); the adjacent `# nosec B310` bandit suppression was re-verified to still be attached to the right line after the merge.
- `backup.py` / `control_center.py` / `journal.py`: `datetime.now()` / `datetime.fromtimestamp()` calls now attach the local timezone via `.astimezone()` (ruff DTZ005/DTZ006) instead of building naive datetimes. Same wall-clock values as before — still local time, not switched to UTC — just with explicit tzinfo instead of implicit.
- `pyproject.toml`: the `[tool.pylint.MASTER]` `init-hook` (carried over from the now-deleted `tests/pylintrc`) had a latent bug — `os.path.dirname(__file__)` inside a pylint init-hook does not resolve to the config file's own location, it resolves to pylint's internal `config_initialization.py` module. The hook was silently inserting pylint's own package directory at the front of `sys.path`, and pylint ships its own internal `pylint/typing.py`, which shadowed the stdlib `typing` module during the production lint run — breaking `@overload` recognition in `utils.py::get_ssot_var` (spurious `E0102 function-redefined`) and, as a side effect, `NamedTuple` detection in `health.py`/`utils.py` (spurious `R0903`), dropping the score from the 10.00/10 baseline to 9.88. The bug was invisible while scoped to the old `tests/pylintrc`-only run because `import-error` is disabled there regardless, so the hook's (never-working) intended effect was never actually exercised. Re-anchored on `os.getcwd()` instead, correctly covering both documented invocations (repo root for the production run, `usr/local/lib/steamos_diy/tests` for the test run).
- `restore.py`: six call sites had been reformatted to single lines over 79 characters (an errant `ruff format` pass mid-migration — this project targets flake8's 79-char limit, not `ruff format`'s 88-char default), which flake8 flagged as `E501`. Re-wrapped to the project's existing multi-line style; no behavior change.
- `health.py`: `_check_groups` resolved every gid from `os.getgroups()` in a single set-comprehension — one stale/deleted gid (a group removed from `/etc/group` after the user's session started, e.g. by a package downgrade) raised `KeyError` and aborted the whole comprehension, falling back to an empty set. The preflight then reported every critical group (`tty`, `video`, `render`, `input`) as missing, even when the user belonged to all of them — a misleading "everything is broken" result caused by one unrelated entry. Now resolves each gid individually and skips only the one that fails.
- `control_center.py`: `load_game_file`/`save_game_profile` derived the profile filename with `raw.split(" (")[0]`, which truncates at the *first* `" ("` in the combo display string. `_format_combo_items` only ever appends the `(AppID)` suffix at the very end, so a detected game whose own name legitimately contains `" ("` (e.g. a shortcut titled "Portal (Test Build)") combined with a numeric AppID suffix silently truncated to `games.d/Portal.yaml` — colliding with, and overwriting, any unrelated game actually named "Portal". Extracted the shared `_extract_game_name_from_display` helper, anchored on the same trailing-`(digits)` regex `_scaffold_game_profile` already trusted for reading the AppID back out.
- `journal.py`: `parse_game_logs` tracked a single "current game name" reassigned on every `chdir` line regardless of which process logged it, so an interleaved `gameID`/`AppID` line from a second, concurrently-running process (e.g. two games launched close together) could get attributed to the wrong game — corrupting the AppID shown for both in the Scan History combo. Now tracks the last-seen name per source pid (parsed from journalctl's own `identifier[pid]:` line prefix) instead of one shared variable.

### Changed
- `utils.py`: added `DEFAULT_GS_BIN`, `DEFAULT_STEAM_BIN`, `DEFAULT_PLASMA_BIN`, `DEFAULT_DBUS_BIN`, and made `CORE_LIB_PATH` public — single source of truth for the session-binary fallbacks and the `libcore.so` path. Previously the four binary defaults were independently re-declared in `session_launch.py`, `session_select.py`, and twice inside `health.py` itself (once in `_BINARY_KEYS`, once inline in `_check_gamescope_flags`); `health.py` also re-derived `libcore.so`'s path from `CORE_LIB_DIR` instead of importing the one `utils.py` actually loads from. All five call sites now import from `utils.py`, so a future relocation of any of these binaries (`qdbus6` across Plasma versions is the realistic case) can't update one copy and silently miss another.
- Tool configuration (`ruff`, `pytest`, `pylint`) consolidated from `pytest.ini` + `usr/local/lib/steamos_diy/tests/pylintrc` into a single root `pyproject.toml` — one source of truth instead of three files that could silently drift apart.

## [2.1.6] — 2026-07-08 — Installer Permissions Fix

### Fixed
- `install.sh`: the SSoT was deployed mode `600 root:root` instead of `644` — 2.1.5 started rendering it on a `mktemp` file (created `0600`) and `cp` propagates the source mode to a newly created destination, so on a fresh install the user session could no longer read `/etc/default/steamos_diy.conf`: Control Center editing and the preflight check both failed. The SSoT, its `.new` staging copy and the pristine template are now written with `install -m 644`, and update mode additionally re-asserts `644` on the live SSoT to heal installations deployed by the 2.1.5 installer. Existing systems can be fixed immediately with `sudo chmod 644 /etc/default/steamos_diy.conf`.
- `uninstall.sh`: also removes `/etc/default/steamos_diy.conf.new` — the template staged by `install.sh --update` (introduced in 2.1.5) would otherwise survive uninstallation.

### Documentation
- README and FAQ now state explicitly what the uninstaller deliberately leaves in place (installed packages, the `[multilib]` repository, group memberships) and why — the previous "full reversibility" wording implied more than the scripts actually do.

## [2.1.5] — 2026-07-07 — In-App Updater

### Added
- **In-app updater**: the Control Center Maintenance tab gains **⬆️ Check for Updates** — it queries the GitHub Releases API (stdlib `urllib`, no new dependencies), compares against the running version and, when a newer release exists, shows the release notes and offers **Download & Install**: the tarball is unpacked into `~/.config/steamos_diy/updates/` (auto-pruned, excluded from backups) and the installer runs visibly in a Konsole window via a polkit prompt — no terminal commands to type. The Qt-side flow lives in the new `updater.py` module (`UpdateManager`), following the `editors.py`/`journal.py` isolation pattern; `utils.py` exposes the Qt-free plumbing (`VERSION`, `check_latest_release`, `download_release`). The extraction uses the tarfile `data` filter (rejects path traversal and special members) and only accepts `https://` tarball URLs.
- `install.sh --update`: non-interactive upgrade mode over an existing installation. Preserves the live SSoT (staging the new template as `steamos_diy.conf.new`, pacman-style, only when it actually changed since the last deploy — a pristine copy is kept in `/var/lib/steamos_diy/ssot.template`), preserves user YAML configs without prompting, wipes `/usr/local/lib/steamos_diy` before redeploying so files dropped by the new release cannot linger, and ends with an automatic reboot after a 10-second `CTRL+C`-abortable countdown.
- New documentation page **Updating**: both update entry points (Control Center and `install.sh --update`), what update mode preserves, and the classic uninstall+reinstall path with its SSoT caveat.

### Fixed
- `install.sh`: user detection only looked at `SUDO_USER`, so under `pkexec` (which exposes `PKEXEC_UID` instead) the "real user" resolved to root and user-space configs would be deployed to `/root`. Both are now resolved, matching `get_real_user()` in `utils.py`.
- `control_center.py`: the window title now shows the installed version.

## [2.1.4] — 2026-07-05 — Codebase Review & Hardening

### Changed
- `backup.py` / `restore.py`: the archive no longer carries executable code. Backup now embeds a plain-data links manifest (`links.txt`, one `link<TAB>target` row per symlink) instead of generating `restore_links.sh`; restore validates every pair against the same path allow-list used for file extraction (both ends must resolve inside it) and recreates the links with `os.symlink` — no shell involved. Archives from previous releases keep working: the legacy script entry is recognised and its `ln -sf` lines are parsed for the same pairs, but the script itself is never executed. This closes the inconsistency where restore carefully validated every extracted file yet ran an embedded shell script as root unvalidated.
- `restore.py`: file modes from the archive are now applied masked to `0o777`, so a crafted archive can no longer plant setuid/setgid files through a root-run restore.

### Fixed
- `health.py`: the gamescope-flags preflight treated `--flag=value` tokens as unknown flags (it compared the whole token against `gamescope --help` output); the flag part is now checked alone, so both `--nested-width 1280` and `--nested-width=1280` validate correctly.
- `control_center.py`: saving a game profile with a `/` in the name could write outside `games.d/`; the save path now applies the same guard as profile loading and reports the rejection in the status bar.
- `control_center.py`: log lines are HTML-escaped before styling, so a literal `<...>` in a journal payload is displayed instead of being swallowed as markup by the rich-text view.
- `steamos_diy_core.c`: `c_jlog` serialises the syslog tag switch with a mutex — ctypes releases the GIL during the call, so two Python threads (e.g. main + `post_start_cmds`) could interleave `closelog`/`openlog` and stamp a message with the wrong tag.
- `sdy.py`: profile lookup by AppID matched the ID as a plain substring, so looking up AppID `220` also matched a profile declaring `SDY_ID: 2201290` — another game's profile (env vars, wrapper) could be applied, with directory scan order deciding the winner. The header scan now uses an end-of-line-anchored declaration match compared for equality; quoted values, CRLF line endings, trailing whitespace and inline comments are all tolerated.
- `utils.py`: `load_yaml_safe` returned the YAML root whatever its type, so a global config whose root is a list or scalar (e.g. a file starting with `- flags:`) crashed the session launcher at boot — `cfg.get()` on a non-dict raised, systemd retried, and the loop ran until the start limit tripped (black TTY1). It now returns `{}` unless the root is a mapping, logging `YAML_NOT_MAPPING` at WARN so the degradation is visible in the journal.
- `health.py`: new preflight check **config root** — a global config that is valid YAML but has a non-mapping root previously passed the whole preflight (the syntax check saw valid YAML and the field-type check silently skipped it), so the doctor reported all-green on a config the launcher would degrade to empty. It is now reported as a failure (`must be a mapping, got <type>`). Empty documents, missing files and parse errors stay with their existing checks.
- `utils.py`: the `get_ssot_var` `@overload` stubs were separated from the implementation by the new cache helpers, tripping type checkers (overload without implementation / redefinition). Runtime was unaffected; mypy is clean again across the package.

### Performance
- `utils.py`: `get_ssot_var` now fills its cache with a single full parse of the SSoT file on first access; later lookups — including keys absent from the file — never re-read the disk (previously every miss re-scanned the whole file).
- `health.py`: the preflight parses the global config once and shares the result across the structural checks (root shape, field types, gamescope flags) instead of re-parsing it per check.

### Documentation
- `Game Wrapper (sdy).md`: AppID discovery wording aligned with the exact-match scan; `SteamMachine DIY Control Center.md`: added the **config root** row to the preflight table and the `--flag=value` note to the gamescope-flags row; `Utilities Engine.md`: documented the mapping-only contract of `load_yaml_safe`, the single-parse SSoT cache, the manifest-based backup contract (`BACKUP_MANIFEST_NAME`) and the missing `get_ssot_num` in the backup.py dependency table; `Backup & Recovery.md`: link-reconstruction and restore-security sections rewritten for the manifest model.
- Header cleanup in shipped templates: the SSoT template header now reads `SteamMachine-DIY - SSoT` (was `SteamOS-DIY - SSOTH`); `config.yaml` and the example templates drop the legacy header flavor (`Converted from Manifesto`, `Hardcore Libre Mode`, version suffixes).

---

## [2.1.3] — 2026-06-24 — Game Mode Session Capabilities

### Added
- `session_launch.py`: `GAME_MODE_ENV` — a fixed map of session environment variables applied before the user's `env_vars`, advertising compositor/Mesa capabilities to Steam so Game Mode exposes the matching Quick Access controls on any GPU. Covers FSR/NIS scaling filters (`STEAM_GAMESCOPE_FANCY_SCALING_SUPPORT`, `STEAM_GAMESCOPE_NIS_SUPPORTED`), tearing / "Disable Vertical Sync" (`STEAM_GAMESCOPE_HAS_TEARING_SUPPORT`, `STEAM_GAMESCOPE_TEARING_SUPPORTED`), the dynamic FPS limiter (`STEAM_GAMESCOPE_DYNAMIC_FPSLIMITER`), latency (`vk_xwayland_wait_ready=false`), embedded-session correctness (`SDL_VIDEO_MINIMIZE_ON_FOCUS_LOSS=0`), plus Proton/vkd3d session defaults from the official gamescope-session (`ENABLE_GAMESCOPE_WSI=1`, `VKD3D_SWAPCHAIN_LATENCY_FRAMES=3`, `WINEDLLOVERRIDES=dxgi=n`). All are panel-independent; the user's `env_vars` are applied afterwards and win. Display-dependent capabilities (VRR/HDR) deliberately stay in the user config. Mirrors the official SteamOS session.
- `session_launch.py`: `-steamdeck` added to the Steam launch flags (`-gamepadui -steamos3 -steamdeck`), unlocking the full Quick Access side menu and its live controls. Additive to `-gamepadui`, not a replacement.
- `config.yaml` (skel default): ships `--hide-cursor-delay 3000` — universal UX polish (hide the idle cursor).

### Changed
- `config.example.yaml`: documented the new model — universal capabilities are now provided automatically by the launcher (no need to set them); a per-display opt-in section shows VRR/HDR/`PROTON_ENABLE_HDR` to enable only when the panel supports it; added the `--hide-cursor-delay` UX flag.
- `docs/`: aligned *Steamos Session Launch* (capabilities table, `-steamdeck`), *Dynamic Gamescope Mapping* (env-var guidance, template) and *Project Overview* with the above. Clarified that `-F fsr` is vendor-agnostic (runs on any GPU), not AMD-only.

---

## [2.1.2] — 2026-06-22 — Control Center Health Tooling

### Added
- `health.py`: new Qt-free backend module (mirrors `journal.py` — pure functions, testable in isolation) exposing config-validation and service-status helpers.
  - `run_preflight()` returns a list of `CheckResult`s covering: SSoT config presence; binary handlers (`bin_gs`/`bin_steam`/`bin_plasma`/`bin_dbus`) resolving to executables; the declared SSoT paths (`user_config`, `games_conf_dir`) actually existing; YAML syntax of the global config and every game profile (reporting the offending line); session-critical group membership (`tty`/`video`/`render`/`input`); C-Core loadability; and a writable session-state directory.
  - It also flags the two top-level config fields the launcher iterates directly (`flags`, `post_start_cmds`) when mistyped as a scalar instead of a list — runtime would otherwise walk a string character-by-character into junk argv. Absent or null fields are correctly treated as empty and skipped. Full schema/semantic validation is deliberately out of scope (the runtime already degrades unexpected keys and bad `LOG_LEVEL`/timing values gracefully).
  - `get_service_status()` / `parse_service_status()` snapshot `steamos_diy.service` via `systemctl show` (no root) into a `ServiceStatus`, degrading missing or non-numeric fields to safe placeholders.
- `control_center.py`: **🩺 Validate Configuration** button (Maintenance tab) runs the preflight off-thread and renders a colour-coded pass/fail report (`preflight_ready` signal) — surfacing a broken config *before* it causes a black-screen boot.
- `control_center.py`: service-health strip in the window status bar — shows `steamos_diy.service` state/sub-state/restart-count/last-exit, colour-coded (green `active`, red `failed`), refreshed every 4 s by a `QTimer` fetching status off-thread (`service_status_ready` signal).
- `backup.py`: automatic archive rotation — after every successful backup, archives beyond the `BACKUP_KEEP` count (new SSoT key, default `5`; `0` disables pruning) are deleted oldest-first, so `~/.config/steamos_diy/backups/` never grows unbounded. The timestamped naming makes lexicographic order chronological and in-flight `.tmp` files are never matched. Removals are logged as `BACKUP_PRUNED`.
- `utils.py`: `clear_ssot_cache()` drops the in-process `_SSOT_CACHE` so long-lived tools (the Control Center doctor) re-validate the *current* on-disk config after an edit instead of returning cached values. `run_preflight()` calls it first, so re-running the doctor after fixing the config no longer requires restarting the Control Center.
- `health.py`: new preflight check **Gamescope flags** — validates the global-config `flags` against the installed `gamescope --help`, flagging any option the running gamescope does not recognise. An unknown or mistyped flag makes gamescope exit at launch, so the session never starts and TTY1 goes black with no hint; catching it before boot is the point. Mirrors the runtime split (`shlex.split` per entry), checks only option tokens (values and negative numbers ignored), and skips itself cleanly when `gamescope --help` can't be run.
- `control_center.py`: **log filter box** in the Diagnostics tab — a search field live-filters the displayed log to lines containing the query (case-insensitive), re-rendering from the cached fetch without re-querying journalctl. Empty query restores the normal deduplicated view; a no-match query shows a hint.
- `control_center.py`: **unsaved-changes guard** — closing the window with unedited-but-unsaved YAML now prompts Save / Discard / Cancel instead of silently dropping the edits, and **Ctrl+S** saves the editor on the active tab (Global Options or Game Overrides; ignored in template view). The editor's modified flag is cleared on load, template toggle and save, so the guard only trips on genuine pending edits.

### Changed
- `control_center.py`: **Export Support Report** (formerly *Export Support Log*) now produces a real diagnostic bundle instead of dumping the on-screen view. The file contains kernel, `steamos_diy.service` status, the full preflight report and the raw last-12h logs (all tags + gamescope), re-fetched independently of the active Diagnostics filter and without the display-side dedup collapse — complete and greppable for issue reports. Default filename is timestamped; the report is built in a worker thread (`_build_support_report`). The journal fetch is shared with the Diagnostics view via the new `journal.fetch_tagged_entries`, so the two paths cannot drift.
- `control_center.py`: `beautify_yaml` now applies the reformat as a single undoable edit (cursor edit-block) instead of `setPlainText`, so `Ctrl+Z` reverts it in one step; the editor's scroll position is preserved (no jump to the top); and the status bar reports the outcome (`✨ YAML formatted` / `Already clean` / `Syntax error — see highlight`).
- `health.py`: review pass — split `_check_yaml_files` into `_check_user_config` + `_check_game_profiles` (one check, one function, matching the structure of every other preflight check) and extracted `_load_user_config` out of `_check_config_types` (loading vs. checking separated). Behaviour identical.
- `install.sh`: the Intel driver set now also installs `intel-media-driver` (iHD) alongside the legacy `libva-intel-driver`. libva probes `iHD` before `i965` on i915, so 64-bit processes (Steam Remote Play encode, browsers) automatically get the actively-maintained VAAPI driver, while 32-bit processes keep falling back to `lib32-libva-intel-driver` (no official `lib32-intel-media-driver` exists — everything stays in the official repos).

### Removed
- `install.sh`: dropped `libva-mesa-driver` / `lib32-libva-mesa-driver` from the AMD driver set — obsolete split-package names absorbed into `mesa` / `lib32-mesa` (already in the same list) since mesa 1:24.2.7; pacman was resolving them as virtual providers of packages being installed anyway.
- `install.sh`: dropped `procps-ng` (dependency of the `base` meta-package — present on every Arch system by definition, and unused by the project) and `mesa-utils` (`glxinfo`/`glxgears` referenced nowhere in code, configs or docs — the stack is Vulkan-centric). `vulkan-tools` stays (`vulkaninfo` is part of the documented troubleshooting workflow) and so does `pciutils` (`lspci` is used by install.sh itself).

### Fixed
- `control_center.py`: `beautify_yaml` no longer destroys a comments-only document. ruamel loads such a document as `None` and would round-trip it to a literal `null`, wiping the user's comments from the editor; it is now left untouched ("Nothing to format").
- `steamos_diy_core.c`: `c_notify` clamped the `snprintf` would-be length to `sizeof(buf)` instead of `sizeof(buf) - 1`, sending the trailing NUL byte to the TTY; a negative return (encoding error) would also have reached `write()` as a huge unsigned length. Both paths are now guarded — the build is clean under `-Wall -Wextra`.
- `steamos_diy_core.c`: `c_sd_notify_ready` passed `sizeof(struct sockaddr_un)` as the address length, which breaks abstract-socket addressing (`@` prefix): abstract names are length-delimited, so the kernel treated the NUL padding as part of the name and `READY=1` went to a non-existent socket. The length is now computed as `offsetof(sun_path) + strlen(path)`, valid for both abstract and filesystem sockets.

### Documentation
- `Utilities Engine.md`: documented `clear_ssot_cache` and added `health.py` to the framework-dependency matrix.
- `SteamMachine DIY Control Center.md`: documented the Validate Configuration button, the service-health strip, the `health.py` backend, and the improved beautify behaviour.
- Full docs/README review pass against the current code: package lists in `README.md` and `Installer Workflow.md` realigned with `install.sh` (Intel VAAPI drivers added, dropped packages removed); duplicated content consolidated to its home page (MangoHud/`--mangoapp` caveat → Dynamic Gamescope Mapping, optional-packages list → Useful Links & Resources, redundant per-tag journalctl rows → tag table); the boilerplate "This page outlines…" opener replaced with a direct per-page summary; minor wording and formatting cleanups.

---

## [2.1.1] — 2026-06-08 — Post-2.1.0 Hardening & KISS/Doc Cleanup Pass

### Added
- `utils.py`: `get_ssot_num(key, default)` — typed accessor that wraps `get_ssot_var` for numeric timing parameters, returning a `float` and falling back to `default` (with a `WARN`) when the value is missing or malformed.
- `steamos_diy.service`: `StartLimitIntervalSec=120` / `StartLimitBurst=10`. `session_launch.py` exits 75 on every session switch (intentional restart) and a crashed Steam already falls back to Desktop via `_handle_recovery`, so legitimate restarts are frequent and self-limiting. This guard only catches the pathological case (both targets crashing instantly, e.g. a broken Plasma/Wayland) — systemd gives up instead of hammering TTY1 at ~1 Hz. Tuned generous enough never to trip on normal Steam↔Desktop toggling.

### Changed
- `sdy.py`: dropped redundant `str()` casts in `_build_command` — `wrapper` and `extra` are already `str` from both branches that build them, so `shlex.split(str(x))` became `shlex.split(x)`.

### Removed
- `install.sh`: dropped `rsync` and `qt6-tools` from `BASE_PKGS`. Neither is used anywhere in the project — backup/restore use `tarfile` (not rsync) and the Control Center is pure PyQt6 at runtime (qt6-tools ships dev-only tooling like Designer). Removing them trims install-time dependency bloat.

### Fixed
- `session_launch.py`: the four timing parameters (`VALIDATION_TIMEOUT`, `TERM_TIMEOUT`, `POST_START_DELAY`, `NOTIFY_DELAY`) were read via bare `int()`/`float()` on the SSoT value. Since `/etc/default/steamos_diy.conf` is hand-editable, a typo (`5s`, an empty value, a decimal comma) raised an unguarded `ValueError` — and for `VALIDATION_TIMEOUT` that aborts `run()` before the session launches, so systemd `Restart=on-failure` would retry, fail again, and loop until the start-limit trips (black TTY, no diagnostic). All four now read through `get_ssot_num`, degrading to their built-in default plus a `WARN` instead of crashing the boot. `TERM_TIMEOUT` in the conf template is now `5.0` for consistency with the float semantics (behaviour unchanged).
- `control_center.py`: the editable game-overrides combo was bound to `currentTextChanged`, which fires on every keystroke — re-scaffolding the editor and discarding edits while the user was still typing a profile name. Rebound to `activated` (selection/Enter only), so the profile loads or scaffolds on confirmation, not mid-type.
- `steamos_diy_core.c`: `c_notify` now clamps the `snprintf` return value before `write()`. `snprintf` returns the *would-be* length, so an oversized status string could make `write()` read past the 256-byte buffer; the length is capped at `sizeof(buf)`.
- `steamos_diy.service`: header `VERSION` corrected `2.0.0` → `2.1.0` — the unit file had been missed by the `.py`/`.sh`/`.conf` version bump.
- `steamos_diy_core.c`: the three fd-opening paths now set the close-on-exec flag — `c_notify` (`O_CLOEXEC` on `/dev/tty1`), `c_write_atomic` (`O_CLOEXEC` on the temp file), and `c_sd_notify_ready` (`SOCK_CLOEXEC` on the AF_UNIX socket). `ctypes` releases the GIL during each C call, so the `post_start_cmds` daemon thread (`session_launch.py`) can `fork`/`exec` a child while one of these fds is briefly open; without close-on-exec the spawned game/helper would inherit that descriptor. The flags close the leak at no added complexity.
- `utils.py`: `_JLOG_REENTRY` recursion guard moved from a shared `list[bool]` to `threading.local()`. The post-start daemon thread and the main thread both call `jlog`; with a single shared flag, a log emitted by one thread while the other held the guard would bypass the `LOG_LEVEL` threshold. Each thread now tracks its own re-entry state independently. (No crash was possible — Python's GIL makes the flag write atomic — but a suppressed-level line from a secondary thread could leak into the journal.)

### Documentation
- `Utilities Engine.md`: documented the new `get_ssot_num` accessor under the Configuration Management section and added it to the `session_launch.py` import matrix.
- `steamos_diy.conf`: noted under "Performance & Timing" that numeric values are plain numbers (no units/comma) and that a malformed value falls back to its default rather than aborting the boot.
- `restore.py`: comment in `_prepare_restore` explaining why `home_str` (unresolved, kept in lockstep with the paths `backup.py` wrote) and `home_real` (symlink-resolved, checked by the security allow-list) intentionally coexist — they are not redundant.
- `SteamMachine DIY Control Center.md`: game-overrides combo description updated — the profile loads (or scaffolds) on selection; typing a new name does not reload until confirmed.
- `control_center.py`: header `DESCRIPTION` corrected — it advertised a non-existent "Search functionality"; now describes the actual dashboard (diagnostics, maintenance, YAML editing). `_run_pkexec` docstring trimmed of the keyword-only rationale already stated in the adjacent pylint-disable comment.
- `sdy.py`: header `DESCRIPTION` reworded "global manifesto" → "global config".
- `Utilities Engine.md`: corrected the `control_center.py` dependency row — it listed `jlog`, but the module actually imports `spawn_native` from `utils`.
- `Installer Workflow.md`, `README.md`: dependency lists synced with `install.sh` (removed `rsync`/`qt6-tools`); documented `gcc` command updated to include `-march=native` (matches `install.sh` and the `Makefile`).
- `Game Wrapper (sdy).md`: the `_build_command` code snippet synced with the source after the redundant `str()` casts were removed.

---

## [2.1.0] — 2026-05-23 — KDE-Focused Hardening & Gamescope Integration

### Added
- `session_launch.py`: post-start hook mechanism — `_get_post_start_cmds()` reads a `post_start_cmds` YAML list from `config.yaml`; `_schedule_post_start_cmds()` fires each command via `spawn_native` in a daemon thread after `POST_START_DELAY` seconds. Enables runtime Gamescope socket commands (e.g. `gamescopectl`) that cannot be expressed as launch flags. Hook is skipped entirely when the list is empty or the target is not `steam`.
- `steamos_diy.conf`: `POST_START_DELAY=2.0` — configurable delay (seconds) before post-start commands are fired; joins the existing timing parameters (`VALIDATION_TIMEOUT`, `NOTIFY_DELAY`, `TERM_TIMEOUT`).
- `config.yaml`: `post_start_cmds:` key — empty by default; populated by the user.
- `config.example.yaml`: documented `--adaptive-sync` and `--mangoapp` flags under a new `VRR / MangoHud` group; added `post_start_cmds` section with `gamescopectl adaptive_sync_ignore_overlay 1` example and inline explanation of the VRR/overlay interaction.

### Fixed
- `helpers/*`: all five SteamOS shims silently fell back to `sys.exit(7/0)` (ImportError path) when invoked via the symlink chain (`/usr/bin/<name>` → `/usr/bin/steamos-polkit-helpers/<name>` → `.py`). The Linux kernel passes the original symlink path — not the resolved target — to the interpreter; `os.path.abspath(__file__)` returned the symlink path, so `sys.path.insert` added `/usr` or `/usr/bin` instead of `/usr/local/lib/steamos_diy`. `utils` was therefore never found and `run_shim` was never reached. Fixed by replacing `os.path.abspath` with `os.path.realpath`, which follows the full symlink chain and returns the canonical file path.
- `journal.py`: gamescope log filter no longer matches arbitrary lines containing "gamescope" as a substring. The Diagnostics tab was picking up Dolphin/kio `copy() QUrl(...)` operations and Plasma `PreviewJob` errors involving `gamescope.example.yaml` files — anything with the word "gamescope" anywhere on the line passed through. Now `journalctl` is invoked with `-t steam -t python3` (the only two identifiers that carry gamescope output: `steam` after the exec hop, `python3` for early CLI errors before exec), and lines must match the upstream gamescope log format (`[Info]`/`[Warn]`/`[Error]`/`[Gamescope WSI]` or `/usr/bin/gamescope:`) via the new `_GAMESCOPE_PAYLOAD` regex. Validated on a real session: 0 false positives, all genuine gamescope output preserved.

### Changed
- `control_center.py`: `_atomic_save()` no longer reimplements `tmp + fsync + rename` in Python; delegates to `write_atomic()` (C-Core, `fdatasync`). Single durability path for both session state writes and Control Center YAML saves.
- `utils.py`: `extract_game_metadata`, `_normalize_appid`, `get_journal_cmd` moved to `journal.py` — the only consumer is the journal pipeline. `journal.py` no longer imports from `utils.py`.
- `utils.py`: `write_atomic()` no longer strips whitespace from values — paranoid `.strip()` removed; all callers already pass clean strings.
- `utils.py`: `SERVICE_PATH` renamed to `_SERVICE_PATH` — the only internal user is `get_backup_mapping`, no external consumer.
- `utils.py`: dead `import re` removed after the regex-using functions were relocated to `journal.py`.
- `install.sh`: C-Core build flags aligned with `Makefile` — `-march=native` added to the `gcc` invocation. The installer always runs on the target machine, so native ISA optimisation is safe and consistent with `make` builds.
- `install.sh`: `disable_display_managers` scope limited to `sddm` and `plasmalogin` — the project targets KDE Plasma exclusively; GNOME and other DMs are out of scope.
- `session_launch.py`: user config YAML loaded once in `run()` and passed as `cfg: dict` to `_build_gamescope_args`, `_build_command_for`, `_get_post_start_cmds`, and `_run_session` — eliminates the duplicate `load_yaml_safe` call that was made separately by `_build_gamescope_args` and `_get_post_start_cmds` at every session start. Also drops the now-redundant `isinstance(cfg, dict)` guard (load_yaml_safe always returns dict).
- `control_center.py`: `_safe_spawn` removed — replaced by direct `spawn_native` calls from `utils.py`. `spawn_native` already provides the same error handling plus `start_new_session=True` (setsid) and stdout/stderr redirect, giving spawned tools (Konsole, xdg-open, session_select) proper process-group isolation from the Control Center.
- `restore.py`: `Path(home).resolve()` simplified to `home.resolve()` — `home` is already a `Path` object returned by `get_real_user()`, so the redundant `Path()` construction is removed.

### Removed
- `control_center.py`: `_safe_spawn` method — redundant wrapper around `subprocess.Popen` superseded by `spawn_native` from `utils.py`.
- `control_center.py`: `_SSOT_KEYS` tuple and `_load_ssot_to_env()` method. The preload had no consumer — no module reads the nine pre-loaded keys via `os.getenv`; subprocesses re-read the SSoT file via `get_ssot_var`. Drops the now-unused `get_ssot_var` import as well.
- `steamos_diy_core.c`: `#include <sys/stat.h>` — zero symbols used in the file, `-Wall -Wextra` still compiles clean.
- `control_center.py`: `OSError` removed from `beautify_yaml` except clause — `yaml_parser.load()` and `yaml_parser.dump()` are pure in-memory operations and cannot raise `OSError`; the handler was dead code.

### Documentation
- `Utilities Engine.md`: opening rewritten in one sentence (matching the other wiki pages); the C-Core philosophy now lives in a dedicated "🔌 C-Core Integration" section. "📖 Journal Utilities" section removed (functions relocated to `journal.py`). Framework Dependencies table updated accordingly.
- `SteamMachine DIY Control Center.md`: `_atomic_save()` and `extract_game_metadata()` descriptions updated to reflect the new module layout. Diagnostics section updated with the narrower journalctl invocation. Orphan paragraph on `_load_ssot_to_env()` removed.
- `Architecture.md`: `journal.py` function list extended with `get_journal_cmd` and `extract_game_metadata`.

---

## [2.0.0] — 2026-05-17 — KISS Audit & Robustness Pass

### Removed
- `utils.py`: `load_ssot()` — one-line wrapper around `os.path.isfile(SSOT_CONF_PATH)`; callers (`backup.py`, `restore.py`) now call it directly.
- `utils.py`: `_parse_yaml()` — private function called only by `load_yaml_safe`; merged into it, eliminating the split.
- `utils.py`: `_chown_recursive()` — private function called only by `fix_ownership`; inlined, error handling unified into a single `except`.
- `backup.py`: `_is_relevant_symlink()` — one-line predicate called only by `_resolve_symlink`; inlined.
- `restore.py`: `_apply_metadata()` — two-line function called only by `_extract_member`; inlined.
- `editors.py`: `_setup_rules()` — called only from `__init__`; inlined.
- `journal.py`: `_is_game_log_line()` — one-line predicate called only by `filter_game_journal_lines`; inlined.
- `session_launch.py`: `STATUS_MAP["crash"]` entry — used by a single fixed access in `_handle_recovery`; replaced by a string literal.
- `session_launch.py`: `_TERM_TIMEOUT` module constant — superseded by SSoT `TERM_TIMEOUT`.
- `install.sh`: `chmod 644 "$LIB_DIR/utils.py"` — dead code, immediately overwritten by `chmod +x "$LIB_DIR"/*.py`.

### Changed
- `utils.py`: `_JLOG_REENTRY` comment reduced to one line.
- `steamos_diy_core.c`: `c_write_atomic` — added `if (!path || !val) return;` NULL guard.
- `steamos_diy_core.c`: `c_notify` — `write(fd, cls, 11)` replaced by `write(fd, cls, strlen(cls))`.
- `steamos_diy.conf`: added `TERM_TIMEOUT=5` — last session-lifecycle timeout not previously SSoT-configurable.
- `session_launch.py`: `_terminate_gracefully` now reads `TERM_TIMEOUT` from SSoT instead of using a hardcoded constant.
- `session_launch.py`: `_monitor_process` parameter renamed `next_sess_path` → `next_path` for consistency with all other functions.
- `session_select.py`: constants renamed `BIN_STEAM_DEFAULT` → `DEFAULT_STEAM_BIN`, `BIN_DBUS_DEFAULT` → `DEFAULT_DBUS_BIN` to align with `session_launch.py` naming convention.
- `sdy.py`: `except (OSError, FileNotFoundError, PermissionError)` collapsed to `except OSError` — `FileNotFoundError` and `PermissionError` are subclasses of `OSError`.
- `sdy.py`: numbered step comments in `run()` removed; only the zero-fork note kept as inline.
- `restore.py`: `_allowed_prefixes` now receives `home_real` (already resolved) instead of `home_str`, eliminating the double `Path.resolve()` call.
- `editors.py`: `line_number_area_width` — `while` loop for digit counting replaced by `len(str(...))`.
- `control_center.py`: timestamp regex compiled as `_LOG_TIMESTAMP_RE` module-level constant instead of inline on every log line.
- `control_center.py`: `_safe_spawn` except clause narrowed from `(subprocess.SubprocessError, OSError)` to `OSError` — `SubprocessError` is never raised by `Popen()`.
- `install.sh`: `disable_display_managers` scope limited to `sddm` and `plasmalogin` — the project targets KDE Plasma exclusively; GNOME and other DMs are out of scope.
- `Makefile`: `DESTDIR` renamed to `INSTALL_DIR` — `DESTDIR` is a Make convention for staging prefixes, not direct install paths.
- `steamos_diy.service`: removed redundant inline comment on `ExecStart`.
- All modules and scripts: version set to `2.0.0`.

### Added
- `editors.py`: new module — `LineNumberArea`, `YAMLEditor`, `YAMLSyntaxHighlighter` extracted from `control_center.py` (SRP: rendering responsibility).
- `journal.py`: new module — all journalctl/gamescope parsing and game detection extracted from `control_center.py` (SRP: system/data layer, no Qt dependency, fully testable in isolation).
- `install.sh`: C-Core post-build verification — gcc failure and `ctypes.CDLL()` loadability check both abort installation with a clear error message.

### Removed
- `steamos_diy_core.c`: `c_get_conf_val`, `c_read_file_simple`, `c_spawn_detached`, `c_monitor_process` — four functions duplicating Python stdlib without real performance gain (all one-shot, never on a hot path). C-Core surface reduced from 8 to 4 functions; the four retained (`c_jlog`, `c_notify`, `c_write_atomic`, `c_sd_notify_ready`) are the ones that actually justify the ctypes bridge: `syslog()` libc binding, `O_NOCTTY` tty write, `fdatasync()` durability, and `NOTIFY_SOCKET` abstract-socket protocol.
- `steamos_diy_core.c`: orphaned helper `trim_inplace` and `#include <ctype.h>` / `<errno.h>` removed after the four functions above were dropped.
- `utils.py`: constants `_SSOT_BUF_SIZE` and `_SESSION_BUF_SIZE` removed — no longer needed once the ctypes buffer round-trip was eliminated.

### Changed
- `install.sh`: filesystem layout paths (`LIB_DIR`, `HELPERS_DIR`, `POLKIT_DIR`, `BIN_DIR`, `SSOT_CONF`, `SERVICE_FILE`, `STATE_DIR`, `APP_DIR`, `ALPM_HOOKS_DIR`, `USER_CONFIG_REL`) hoisted to a single top-level `readonly` block. Previously, `/usr/local/lib/steamos_diy` and friends were repeated inline in 6+ places; `LIB_DIR` was set inside `deploy_files` as an implicit global. The new block is labelled as the shared contract with `utils.py`.
- `install.sh`: two-hop alias creation (`/usr/bin/<name>` → `$POLKIT_DIR/<name>`) collapsed into a `for` loop. Two desktop-entry copies collapsed likewise.
- `uninstall.sh`: same `readonly` top-level block as `install.sh` (must mirror it — every uninstall path corresponds to an install path). Both shim-alias and CLI-tool removals collapsed into `for` loops over the same name lists install.sh writes.
- `Makefile` + `install.sh`: build flags aligned. Both now use `-O2 -fPIC -Wall -Wextra -shared`. Previously `Makefile` had `-Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter` while `install.sh` had only `-Wall` — silent divergence between dev (`make`) and prod (`./install.sh`) builds. `-Wno-unused-parameter` removed since the post-pass-1 C-Core compiles clean without it. `docs/Installer Workflow.md` updated to match.
- `uninstall.sh`: DM detection cascade rewritten — four sequential `systemctl list-unit-files | grep -q X` calls (one per `elif` branch) replaced by a single cached `dm_units` query plus a `for | break` over the priority list. Extending the priority list is now a one-line edit.
- `utils.py`: new exports `USER_CONFIG_REL`, `BACKUP_SCRIPT_NAME`, and `get_backup_mapping(home)` — single source of truth for the backup-archive format contract. Adding/removing entries now happens in one place instead of being mirrored across `backup.py._backup_sources` and `restore.py._build_mapping`.
- `backup.py`: removed local constants `_USER_CONFIG_REL` and `_RESTORE_SCRIPT_NAME` (centralised in `utils.py`); removed `_backup_sources()` — `_add_payload` iterates `get_backup_mapping()` directly. `_USER_BACKUPS_REL` derived from `USER_CONFIG_REL`.
- `restore.py`: removed local constants `_USER_CONFIG_REL` and `_RESTORE_SCRIPT_ARCNAME`; removed `_build_mapping()` — `_prepare_restore` calls `get_backup_mapping()` directly.
- `restore.py`: `_extract_payload` now returns `TarInfo | None` instead of `bool`. `_run_restore_script` takes the member directly, eliminating the second `tar.getmember(BACKUP_SCRIPT_NAME)` lookup and its `try/except KeyError` guard.
- `control_center.py`: hardcoded `~/.config/steamos_diy` replaced by `Path.home() / USER_CONFIG_REL` — third duplicate of the user-config path eliminated.
- `control_center.py`: `cleanup_logs_privileged` and `_run_privileged_script` merged into a single `_run_pkexec(cmd, ok_title, ok_msg, err_title, err_msg)`. Same daemon-thread + signal-emit pattern was duplicated across two methods; one of them only differed by passing `python3 <script>` vs `journalctl` as the pkexec payload. All three privileged operations (vacuum, backup, restore) now share one code path.
- `control_center.py`: `_atomic_save` now reuses `_highlight_yaml_error` for the YAML parse-error case instead of re-implementing the `getattr(err, "problem_mark", None)` extraction inline.
- `session_launch.py`: `_run_session` no longer takes a `set_proc_ref` callback; the run-level `proc_holder` list is passed in directly. Removes the `lambda p: proc_holder.__setitem__(0, p)` indirection — same shared-cell semantics in fewer hops.
- `sdy.py`: removed single-use wrapper `_resolve_games_dir()`; replaced by `get_ssot_var("games_conf_dir", _FALLBACK_GAMES_DIR)` which already handles the default-fallback case natively.
- `utils.py`: `get_ssot_var` rewritten in pure Python (line-by-line `key=value` parse with quote-stripping via the new `_strip_quotes` helper). Same API and same in-process caching, but no ctypes round-trip — eliminates one buffer allocation and one UTF-8 decode per cache miss.
- `utils.py`: `read_session_target` rewritten as `open().readline()` + `_strip_quotes`. Removes the parallel C path for a one-line file read.
- `utils.py`: `spawn_native` now uses `subprocess.Popen(start_new_session=True)` instead of `c_spawn_detached`. `subprocess` already performs `fork` → `setsid` → `execv` with `/dev/null` redirection — the C reimplementation was pure duplication.
- `helpers/*`: `sys.path.insert` path derived dynamically via `os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))` instead of hardcoded `/usr/local/lib/steamos_diy`. Resilient to installation path changes.
- `utils.py`: YAML backend unified on `ruamel.yaml` (`typ="safe"`) — PyYAML (`python-yaml`) dependency removed. Single YAML library across the entire project.
- `sdy.py`: `_resolve_effective_name` — single `Path` object instead of two redundant constructions from the same string.
- `install.sh`: `python-yaml` removed from `BASE_PKGS` — no longer a dependency.
- `utils.py`: `verify_archive()` — shared gzip-tar integrity check, eliminates duplicated logic from `backup.py` and `restore.py`.
- `utils.py`: `run_shim()` — single entry point for SteamOS compatibility shims, eliminates boilerplate duplication across all five helpers.

### Changed
- All Python modules: docstrings refactored — verbose Args/Returns blocks removed where the signature is self-explanatory, filler phrases replaced with concise imperative descriptions.
- `utils.py`: `get_ssot_var()` now exposes two typed overloads — callers passing a `str` default receive `str` back; callers omitting default receive `str | None`. Eliminates downstream type-narrowing workarounds.
- `utils.py`: Removed `spawn_process()` and `monitor_pid()` — confirmed dead code with no callers anywhere in the codebase. Removed the corresponding orphaned ctypes binding for `c_monitor_process`.
- `utils.py`: `load_yaml_safe` split into `_parse_yaml` (try/except body) + `load_yaml_safe` (guard layer). Signature extended to `str | Path | None` — honest, since the body already handled `None` via the `not path` guard.
- `sdy.py`: Removed `_load_profiles()` single-use wrapper — its `if x else {}` guards were redundant since `load_yaml_safe` already handles `None`. Calls inlined directly in `run()`.
- `session_launch.py`: `_post_session_message` simplified — `original_target` parameter removed; condition `target != original_target or target == "desktop"` reduced to `target == "desktop"` (the first clause is always subsumed by the second in the crash-recovery flow).
- `restore.py`: `run_restore` split into `_prepare_restore` (pre-flight validation: root check, SSoT, file existence, archive integrity) and `_execute_restore` (archive extraction, link script, systemd reload).
- `restore.py`: `_extract_payload` return type changed from `str | None` to `bool` — only its truthiness was ever used by the caller.
- `restore.py`: Removed duplicate `_RESTORE_SCRIPT_NAME` constant — identical value already held by `_RESTORE_SCRIPT_ARCNAME`.
- `control_center.py`: SRP refactoring — rendering and parsing layers moved to `editors.py` and `journal.py`; file reduced from ~1230 to ~400 lines. UI wiring, signal handling, and YAML editor operations remain.
- `control_center.py`: `on_tab_changed` — magic index `0` replaced with `self.tabs.indexOf(self.diag_tab)` (resilient to tab reordering).
- `control_center.py`: `load_logs` — redundant `re.sub` ASCII-strip on combo values removed (combo items are pure ASCII).
- `control_center.py`: `beautify_yaml` refactored — error-highlight logic extracted into `_highlight_yaml_error`; the `if hl:` guard removed (highlighter is always set after `_setup_ui()` and `beautify_yaml` is only reachable via button clicks after full init).
- `control_center.py`: Maintenance tab now uses absolute executable paths (`/usr/bin/python3`, `/usr/bin/konsole`, `/usr/bin/xdg-open`) consistent with the rest of the codebase.
- `control_center.py`: `_safe_spawn` error path now logs via `jlog` instead of `sys.stderr.write`, respecting the configured `LOG_LEVEL` filter.
- `journal.py`: `parse_game_logs` — game detection loop collapsed from four methods (`_parse_game_logs`, `_update_detection`, `_apply_name_hit`, `_apply_id_hit`) into a single readable loop. Orphan constants `_GAME_DIR_PATTERN` and `_GAME_ID_PATTERN` removed (parsing delegated to `extract_game_metadata()` in `utils.py`).
- `helpers/*`: all five SteamOS shims (`steamos-update`, `jupiter-biosupdate`, `jupiter-dock-updater`, `set-timezone`, `steamos-select-branch`) rewritten to use `run_shim()` from `utils.py`.
- All subprocess calls now use absolute executable paths throughout (`/usr/bin/systemctl`, `/usr/bin/journalctl`, `/usr/bin/chown`, `/usr/bin/pkexec`).
- `backup.py`: Corrected misleading comment on `_EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS` — old wording incorrectly implied "backups" was a safe name; corrected to clarify component-level exclusion behaviour.

### Fixed
- `session_launch.py`: session switches went to a black screen on `Restart=on-failure`. When the user switched mode, the running child (Steam/Plasma) exited cleanly, `run()` returned, Python exited with code 0, and systemd's `Restart=on-failure` policy correctly treated that as "success — do not restart" — leaving TTY1 unmanaged. The fix flow now exits with `EX_TEMPFAIL` (75) after a natural child-process exit so systemd reboots the launcher, which then reads the freshly-persisted `next_session` value and spawns the new target. The SIGTERM/SIGINT handler still exits 0, so `systemctl stop` continues to work without a restart loop.
- `install.sh`: latent fresh-install crash — `cp -f "$CONFIG_SRC"/*.yaml ...` failed under `set -e` when the user-config template dir existed but was empty (default bash glob keeps `*.yaml` literal and `cp` errors out). Added a `compgen -G` guard mirroring the existing one on the destination side and restructured the `if/elif` so all three branches (no templates / merge / fresh) are handled explicitly.
- `restore.py`: path traversal vulnerability in `_resolve_target` — `realpath` lexical collapsing of `file/..` allowed a crafted archive member (e.g. `system/steamos_diy.conf/../../shadow`) to resolve to `/etc/shadow`, which legitimately matched the `/etc/` allow-list prefix. Fix: reject any member whose path contains `..` components before resolution.
- `steamos_diy_core.c`: `c_write_atomic` — `rename()` return value was ignored; failure (e.g. `EXDEV`) silently left the target unchanged and the `.tmp` file on disk. Fix: check return, log via `syslog(LOG_ERR, ...)`, unlink orphan on failure.
- `session_launch.py`: `_terminate_gracefully` — `proc.terminate()` called unconditionally; if the process had already exited (returncode set), `os.kill()` targeted a potentially recycled PID. Fix: guard with `proc.returncode is None`.
- `sdy.py`: `_build_command` — `GAME_WRAPPER or os.getenv(...)` treated an explicit empty string (`GAME_WRAPPER: ""`) as absent, silently falling back to the environment variable and ignoring the per-game override. Fix: use `None` as sentinel; fall back only when the key is absent from the profile.
- `control_center.py`: `cleanup_logs_privileged` — two sequential `pkexec journalctl` calls (rotate then vacuum) risked a polkit auth timeout between them, leaving the journal rotated but not vacuumed. Fix: single invocation with `--rotate --vacuum-time=1s`.
- `steamos_diy.service`: `Restart=always` prevented `systemctl stop` from working — the service restarted immediately, making maintenance and debug impossible without `systemctl disable`. Fix: `Restart=on-failure`; crash recovery behaviour is unchanged since `session_launch.py` exits 0 on clean SIGTERM.
- `steamos_diy.service`: missing `After=dbus.service systemd-logind.service` — the service could start before D-Bus was ready, causing silent failures in Steam's D-Bus integration.
- `restore.py`: Silent `except OSError: pass` in `_write_member` replaced with an explicit `WARN`-level log entry — unlink failures are now surfaced instead of swallowed silently.
- `control_center.py`: `_update_detection` was indexing `dict[str, str]` with a `str | None` value — added explicit `is not None` guards to match the logical guarantee already present in the data flow.
- `backup.py` / `restore.py`: `get_real_user()` returns `(str, Path)`; explicit `str(home)` conversion added to prevent `Path`-vs-`str` type errors at call sites.

### Changed
- `uninstall.sh`: removed unreachable `exit 0` after `exec systemd-run` (exec replaces the process).
- `uninstall.sh`: removed aggressive `chvt 1` VT takeover — no longer needed after cgroup escape approach.
- `uninstall.sh`: moved `finalize_uninstallation()` call to after the reboot prompt, so cleanup completes before any reboot.
- All components: normalized `PHILOSOPHY` header to `KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)` across all files.

### Fixed
